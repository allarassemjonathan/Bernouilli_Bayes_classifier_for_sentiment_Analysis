__label__2 Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"
__label__2 One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.
__label__1 Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
__label__2 works fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.
__label__2 Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.
__label__1 DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.
__label__1 Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
__label__1 DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.
__label__2 Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. "Dr Shen Fu", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.
__label__1 Not an "ultimate guide": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
__label__2 Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there.
__label__1 Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.
__label__1 A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my "operating system limitations". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
__label__2 TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
__label__1 didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.
__label__1 Don't buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!
__label__2 Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
__label__2 Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.
__label__2 SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas, lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES, DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !
__label__2 Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
__label__1 Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book
__label__1 Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
__label__2 one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
__label__2 Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation.
__label__1 Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.
__label__1 Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done.
__label__2 works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40' going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know.
__label__1 Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
__label__2 wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc.
__label__1 Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
__label__2 This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
__label__2 Mary Ash: Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
__label__2 Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!
__label__2 This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
__label__2 They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD, which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity. This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well.
__label__1 Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
__label__2 Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
__label__1 Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.
__label__2 Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.
__label__1 Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.
__label__2 WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that "hunt the tomorrow" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see...
__label__1 Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund.
__label__2 Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.
__label__2 Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would, but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone.
__label__2 Amazing...: love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
__label__2 Leslie in a nutshell: Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal, is an amazing little pedal!I use it with guitar, and keyboards.Using with Keyboards, organ mode(doesn't matter which type) jazz, rock, gives me an instant controllable Leslie effects.it includes fast and slow ramp up,boost, volume/drive. thru a mixer in stereo you can do some amazing stuff with this inexpensive unit.The only drawback i have found is the buttons are very hard to engage and disengage.But i'm working on that. i will modify the springs if possible and maybe even send a recommendation to Danelectro.
__label__1 More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the "dark" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!
__label__1 A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame.
__label__1 Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
__label__2 Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.
__label__2 Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always "one against the world", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
__label__2 Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exeptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great.
__label__1 12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell, I have heard many more clever jokes and "one-liners" watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS, it's THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly, Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective, this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!
__label__1 I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude "jokes". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.
__label__2 Wonderful, baffling mix: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird
__label__2 No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
__label__1 Disappointment at it's extreme: I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author.
__label__2 From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
__label__2 An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the "evil" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give "gifts" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell's books, especially if they are at all like this novel.
__label__2 great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie, where is it?: the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?
__label__2 Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
__label__1 Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.
__label__2 Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The "sale" prices are right for a high About end racquet, racquets and Black Knight in Have a reputation for overall durability so you Should get plenty of use Before replacement. Note: I got my first C2C as a D level player and did not like it Immediately. Howeve, as my game improved version I switched from my Bandit Black Knight C2C White racquet to the great success and Have HAD. So, It Might not be the right racquet for a beginner, intermediate to advanced players But Will Benefit From this fine racquet.
__label__1 A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
__label__1 Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational.
__label__2 sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky, secluded,isolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago, millions and millions of people, and she sings stark loneliness
__label__2 Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
__label__1 Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
__label__1 Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then: I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.
__label__2 The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
__label__2 Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.
__label__2 I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.
__label__1 WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.
__label__1 CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!
__label__1 Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
__label__1 nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
__label__2 Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.
__label__1 conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works.
__label__1 Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left.
__label__1 1, and thats being generous....: I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read"To Tess, who thinks it's about time"Author, I think she may mean something else....
__label__2 Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
__label__2 I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
__label__2 A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other "Woman against the odds" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's "Shelters of Stone".
__label__1 where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
__label__1 Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:"Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong."There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it.
__label__1 ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
__label__2 The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
__label__1 This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, "The Custom-House." Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition.
__label__2 Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
__label__1 A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point.
__label__1 Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call "classics". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?
__label__2 Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.
__label__1 Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
__label__1 Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.
__label__2 The "Scarlet" Letter: Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.
__label__2 The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.
__label__1 The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!
__label__2 This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter, I disagree. It's no wonder that people that don't know how to capitalize the word 'I'. I thought that this book was wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
__label__1 I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
__label__2 Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off.
__label__1 same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin
__label__2 Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell
__label__1 Unreadable!: As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
__label__1 Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment.
__label__1 Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
__label__1 one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.
__label__2 Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.
__label__1 very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.
__label__1 Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.
__label__1 Not the worst, but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book "The 50 worst films of all time". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!
__label__1 Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. "Love Changes Everything" is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French "Chanson d'Enfance."I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money.
__label__2 It Rises above the "Fluff" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on "emotional states" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic.
__label__2 Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced her name and address.
__label__2 great IMO: First of all, I saw the review by "Tyley Mike "Relite"" and thought he was grossly overcritical of EVERYTHING and every instrument played... so I'd like to hear Tyley Mike's album, since he thinks he can do better :) --seriously! I think some people don't understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can't write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn't evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and "grow".There's too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don't think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I'll just give it my 5 stars :)
__label__2 I wish...: ...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
__label__2 Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one.
__label__1 WOW!: This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.
__label__2 80s Hard Rock: One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
__label__1 Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80's died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.
__label__2 Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever.
__label__2 Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
__label__2 Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
__label__2 There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.
__label__2 I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! "They don't know entertainment" as Krusty would say: I do love "Charlie Brown's Christmas", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because "Charlie Brown's Christmas" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!
__label__2 Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
__label__2 Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - "Sparky" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
__label__2 great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
__label__2 Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
__label__2 The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.
__label__2 Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself, with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!
__label__1 Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?
__label__1 After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality.
__label__2 Works great, and half the price: This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch).
__label__2 This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
__label__2 Quite Satisfactory: This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.
__label__2 Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it.
__label__1 Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
__label__1 Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the "brick" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.
__label__2 So much better than the apple version!: I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!
__label__2 Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply.
__label__1 If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14"). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
__label__1 Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.
__label__1 Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.
__label__2 Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding.
__label__2 TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente, todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!
__label__2 Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of "playing with future" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull
__label__1 book only, no jacks: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
__label__2 Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
__label__1 Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though "O please get over yourself". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time.
__label__1 Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.
__label__1 Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.
__label__1 Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing.
__label__2 Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short.
__label__2 My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep, I will say read I Spy in bed.
__label__2 Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others.
__label__1 I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
__label__2 Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start.
__label__2 Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white, and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don't wear them with sandals, they aren't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker, but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers, the white and colored part are thin, stretchy and breathable, flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose.
__label__2 A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea "Individual Rights" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that "we have it in our power to make the world over again", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing "We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!
__label__2 I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
__label__2 Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
__label__2 Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
__label__2 Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's "Hungry Again," and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's "I Still Miss Someone" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely "Will He Be Waiting For Me." This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.
__label__2 Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!
__label__1 Band saves CD: As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work.
__label__2 Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!
__label__2 The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
__label__2 non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!
__label__1 worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
__label__2 One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading.
__label__2 excellent: Good price, excellent design and shipped well.Would've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving.
__label__2 Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come.
__label__1 Maybe next time...: I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case.
__label__2 To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game.
__label__1 Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about. Sorry Core and Eidos, this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well. What a boost this could have been for you.
__label__1 Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
__label__1 Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book: This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!
__label__2 this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs (if insects can be called beautiful). The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.
__label__1 Good, but only to the midway point: This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.
__label__1 a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS.
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
__label__1 Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended.
__label__1 Well, not everything: It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of "real life" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a "good enough" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.
__label__1 Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
__label__1 Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of "executive summary" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
__label__2 The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies.
__label__2 Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it.
__label__1 elem diff e-q's: While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading.
__label__2 This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
__label__1 Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past.
__label__2 A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's "How to get control of time and your life", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.
__label__1 Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?: I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!
__label__2 Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.
__label__1 Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__2 The meaning of God, the meaning of life.: Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future.
__label__1 You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now.
__label__1 junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
__label__2 fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
__label__1 Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
__label__2 Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia.
__label__1 Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.
__label__1 Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.
__label__1 Stuck With You: I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.
__label__2 None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author.
__label__2 Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan.
__label__2 Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!
__label__1 lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!: First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together. No, really...they were. The printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them.
__label__1 Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
__label__2 Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening.
__label__1 broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
__label__1 Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the "ON" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the "OFF" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.
__label__1 Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?
__label__2 Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
__label__1 THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE, AND IT REALLY SUCKED!!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS, DON'T, IT'S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
__label__2 Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information
__label__2 LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.
__label__2 CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
__label__1 I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.
__label__1 More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of "Billy the Kid" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.
__label__1 waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!
__label__2 CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
__label__2 Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy, California is happy, and I'm happy.
__label__1 "THE ROCKETS RED GLARE" ???: This over-priced pain in "the sitting area" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug.
__label__2 Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of "shaky" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price
__label__2 A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled.
__label__1 Love Jerry and Dean, just not this version: I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection.
__label__1 Crap, Junk, Worthless, etc: The other 1-star poster is absolutely correct; these things are crap. I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn't seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless. I had high hopes for this toy because of my love for it when I was younger. As always, the quality of these "nostalgic" toys leave much to be desired (I'm looking at you, Evel Knievel Dare Devil Stunt Set!). The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper.
__label__2 Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles.
__label__2 I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: "For office slaves, Internet addicts and stressed-out students." (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved, but still want to feel better, relax and also rejuivinate, AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age, then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!
__label__2 An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
__label__1 not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me, don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it. The title is misleading.
__label__2 Typical Thomas video, all about James: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.
__label__1 Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand "new" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons.
__label__1 Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
__label__2 Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable.
__label__2 "Like this" by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic "clean up the ghetto". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it.
__label__1 A Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is "Buyer beware"
__label__2 A peek inside the process.: First thing's first, "Homespun" is an album of demos for "Apple Venus". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, "Skylarking" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for "Apple Venus". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts "River of Orchids" and "Green Man".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original ("Knights in Shining Karma"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out "Apple Venus", it's a fine record.
__label__2 As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work.
__label__2 a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read.
__label__1 Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software...
__label__2 Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!
__label__2 Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
__label__2 I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found "Quaker Oat Bran" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too.
__label__2 Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT.
__label__2 Its a cable: Its a cable, it works, what else do you want? I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it. Yea!! But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for. Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market. who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.
__label__2 awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
__label__2 I'm grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising.
__label__2 Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian, I would say that "Lifetimes" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: "Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever." This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that "Lifetimes" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.
__label__2 Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me, I lost everything today,The only one, and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me.The cover of the Police's "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" is one of the more interesting covers I have ever heard.If you liked "From One" the buy this disc. I would love to see these guy live.
__label__1 USA1: Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
__label__2 Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one.
__label__1 This book is messed up: In this book, not only is there no real "love" scenes, but to top it off, the girl's cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded.
__label__2 Impressive: One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.
__label__2 The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
__label__1 Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises "hick" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), "The Mothman Prophecies" is a considerable disappointment.
__label__1 SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!: Let me just start by saying that the " MOTHMAN PROPHECIES" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead.
__label__1 And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don't mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining. This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about "the mothman" in it.
__label__1 Mothman proficies ?: 257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else.
__label__1 Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:" so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt." what!? I'm thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this "mysterious" guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote" was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control."what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush
__label__1 Are you joking?: I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction, right? There is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever: no science, no documentary or physical evidence, nothing! There are no MIBs (except in the movies), no secret "conspiracies" to hide evidence of alien visitations, no alien abductions,... absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true.Ask yourselves: If this is really true, then why, with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos, financial scandals, politcal dirty tricks, payoffs, espionage and intelligence screwups and the like, how any "conspiracy" of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation?It simply makes no sense. It is pure entertainment, nothing more.And you Five-Star reviewers have credit cards....?
__label__1 fine if you support terrorism: I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-"Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop" [reffering to LTTE snipers]"Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop"She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here.
__label__2 Good for afterwork cruising, better for airplane tranquility: Listening to this cd, I turned my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. The lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It does have a political overtone, but it's ok, I like the revolution type mood. It's actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head.
__label__1 What's the big deal?: The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music.
__label__2 Excellant: I love Kala as well, because it sounds cleaner and more developed. However this album was an excellant break out in her career. fire, fire is one of my favorites. Mix with marijuana.
__label__2 So Original, So Fun: A friend introduced me to this CD and it's quickly become a favourite. M.I.A.'s music so catchy and so fun to dance to, yet it's also lasting...I've been listening to it over and over. And I love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music.
__label__1 noritake colorwave stoneware: I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time.
__label__2 A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway.: Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's.
__label__2 Old age gold...: As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC.
__label__1 Tiene que ser sensilla!!: Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!
__label__1 Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.
__label__1 Worst book I've ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I "attempted" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade.
__label__2 Frankenstein Continued??: When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist.
__label__1 Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous "Remove cassette" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for "canon zr users group" and "eating tapes" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders.
__label__1 My [Goodness]!!!!: world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv's, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!
__label__2 Lots of effects, lightweight & easy to use.: Awesome Camcorder & Camera functions in this lightweight, easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me, right out of the box. This camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects, and options to make really interesting video effects. I love this camcorder!
__label__2 excellent book for the novice improviser to the instructor: Izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging. His explaination of the games with goals, group size, time, process and variations for each of the games is very helpful. It is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his/her team thinking creatively, working on teamwork and self confidence. My only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it isn't long enough. Write another.
__label__2 hard -to-find tension rods: Our living room has a "bow" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
__label__2 YES, YES, YES great read: Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol
__label__2 A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
__label__2 Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided ,"hey why not?" now that i read this fab manga,theres no turning back!!!this is totally a keeper! i strongly recomend!!!!
__label__1 If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.: I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album, you probably already have all the songs on this album so don't waste your money. The only reason I would recommend someone to but this album is if they did not buy the box set. I wish I had my $10.00 back.
__label__1 Ehh: The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
__label__1 "True" Nirvana sucks: I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are "illegal". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is "true" Nirvana, then "true" Nirvana sucks.
__label__1 garbage: Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag.
__label__1 Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.
__label__2 Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I'm wanting matching in a smaller glass and can't seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these.
__label__2 Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more "Adventure! Action!" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!
__label__1 The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word "ficbe" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition.
__label__1 Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done.
__label__1 Lame Jujitsuka: I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.
__label__1 Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.
__label__2 Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third): In the forest of Midworld, one had better learn to hug close to one's home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants, animals, insects, and other beings less well categorized.Yet, despite a living space defined by various levels of Hell below and above, this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors. Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself. As much as possible on this planet, he's experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction.
__label__2 Best Alan Dean Foster book!: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one. It'll be fun, and you won't be able to put it down.After finishing this one, try hunting down "Dark Star", a movie-novelization that is almost as good as "Midworld".
__label__1 Plain Putrid: This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak.
__label__1 Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read "Tess" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on "Tess.."
__label__1 Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
__label__1 Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
__label__1 The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals.: Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards.
__label__2 Obligatory: My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
__label__2 Good Companion Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
__label__2 Great classic: I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations, albeit some self imposed.
__label__2 Beautifully written, dark Masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.: A beautifully written, dark masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl. Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich 'relatives' with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!
__label__1 I hated this book then....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done.
__label__1 Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor's edition. I guess I'll have to go back to B&N.
__label__1 Ummm: I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
__label__2 Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the "manned mission to Mars" genre.
__label__2 Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch 'Newland' in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.
__label__1 Please read Kundera's book instead: Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: "The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."
__label__2 Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his "lightness of being".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out.
__label__2 Milan Kundera rides again...: A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded.
__label__1 Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
__label__1 The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler): Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident.
__label__1 disappointed: I have been very impressed by other "pickin on" music: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zep, Santana, to name a few I have. However, Hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly.
__label__2 The birth of Drone??: As far as I know,this predates anything else known as "drone" music,which seems to be a popular genre these days.This is about as psychedelic as it gets,your mind wandering out into the infinite void.So good.
__label__2 Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life.
__label__2 Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I'm only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it's like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water, and there is nothing else in it I couldn't pronounce. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it's like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in. The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!
__label__2 Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body--I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out.
__label__2 Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read "On The Road", "The Town and The City", and just before this one, "The Subterraneans", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer.
__label__2 On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.
__label__1 Flat Kerouac: I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.
__label__1 Self Indulgent Nonsense: The operative word from the title is "bums". This is a book about them and their self indulgent, self righteous idleness. A work with no redeeming features.
__label__1 Outlines of Theology, AA Hodge: Kindle edition: Very disappointed. The book is a great work, but there are so many unreadable words in the Kindle e-book edition that after a few pages of frustration, you finally give up trying. This product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable.
__label__2 Life changing!: This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
__label__1 not worth it: mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
__label__1 WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!
__label__1 Not really a good movie: This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth.
__label__2 transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
__label__2 Loved It!: I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
__label__2 Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME, the family loved it and was so very HAPPY to watch and enjoy on a great family evening, Thanks Bunches!
__label__2 TRANFORMERS DARK OF THE MOON: transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation
__label__1 1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness: When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd).
__label__2 Yeah: I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad.
__label__1 Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!: This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.
__label__1 instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d: I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection.
__label__1 Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy?: Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!
__label__1 Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one: No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored.
__label__1 Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
__label__1 Transformers: Dark of the Moon: By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than "Ooh, big robots and explosions!" But hey, for some, that's really all you need.
__label__1 The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.: The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck.
__label__1 The perfect movie, for a 12 yr old: I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life.
__label__1 Lights out on this awful film: I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as "immature" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.
__label__1 Not that great: The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok. The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed.
__label__1 Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12: I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description.
__label__2 Love this movie: Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
__label__1 Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie.
__label__2 Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.
__label__2 Transformers Dark of the Moon: A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
__label__1 Movie is ok, but..................: the title of the disk pack is totally wrong.It should be Blue Ray + DVD and digital copy available for DLa 210gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it, to me is lame.you enter a very long url, then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie, and get a error 404 website not foundI can get to any other web site I enter, but not to the Transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessed.Paramount should take lessons from Fox on how to include the digital copy
__label__2 Guys Movie: So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.
__label__1 Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!: I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?
__label__2 Transformers: Dark of the Moon: watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
__label__1 Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....: I know a lot of movies aren't going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest. Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful
__label__1 Safety pins: As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
__label__1 Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler: Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
__label__2 B-Movie-Licious: I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though.
__label__1 Hell no.: Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it, if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie.*Update:Marine II will star Ted Dibease HAHAHAHAHAHAH LOL!!!! pathetic.
__label__1 What a complete and utter waste of time, and money.: This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....
__label__1 Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!: I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today.
__label__2 Sony E-Marker is now obsolete: Excellent Product, but Sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of Sept so don't bother buying. Shame as it was really good while it lasted.
__label__2 good idea, good looks, needs lots of work: I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
__label__1 Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.
__label__1 worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to "enable" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.
__label__1 Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.
__label__1 Sony has pulled the plug: Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them.
__label__1 Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
__label__1 Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.
__label__1 Artwork???: Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
__label__1 Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.
__label__1 "I Can Read" book has better illustrations: While the stories in the "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, "In A Dark, Dark Room", which was written for Level 2 of the "I Can Read!" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."
__label__1 The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...: I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the "scary" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator.
__label__1 Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to "freestyle" and "improvisation". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy.
__label__1 Tongue hurt my ankle: The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return.
__label__1 Buy the 1993 version instead.: I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive "pamphlet" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.
__label__2 Protection Advice: All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction.
__label__1 know the source of your information: While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive.
__label__2 Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.: We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that, in addition to having great scenes of the Dingle countryside, it also has a very good story line. And, terrific acting and some Irish history thrown in for good measure.
__label__2 Viewed it yesterday: This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
__label__1 Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean.
__label__2 Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie. The seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though I was buying from a friend. Way to do business!!
__label__1 it sounds great!~!~!~!~!: it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
__label__2 It's a very reliable printer...: I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is, if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card, you don't have to be connected to your PC. Just know which numbers you want to print, enter and off it goes. The quality of my prints has been great. Right now it's connected to my iMac and is doing splendidly. It's quite dependable and not expensive. I'd recommend it highly.*****
__label__1 Grindhouse?: I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
__label__1 Am I missing something?: Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it), but for the horrible way it displays on my iPad.The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?
__label__2 Is honesty always rewarded ?: Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!
__label__2 LOVE THIS BOOK: I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
__label__2 Awesome if not overplayed: The first 5 songs are incredible, and the rest are OK. I live in France and Chumbawamba never got really big there so I haven't heard tubthumping a zillion times, which makes it still interesting to listen to.
__label__2 A Great CD for all people: I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus, the trumpet playing is great! I also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together. This is truly a masterpiece
__label__2 Beyond the mega-hit, preview of better things to come: Besides the much maligned mega-hit "Tubthumping" which I didn't like when it was first released but like now, this is a solid CD with great arrangements, lyrics, and performances. It's not perfect but how many CD's are perfect these days? I have recently discovered "Ready Mades and Then Some" - clearly a 5-star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song. Masterfully done. I won't write a song-by-song critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that. However, I do put forward a challenge to "rtbarry" in AZ to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a "review", if he is capable, to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this CD that rates it only one star? Or, does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were Kim Jong-il of North Korea? Otherwise, "rtbarry" don't waste our time with drivel.
__label__2 It's Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
__label__1 The One Star: The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd.
__label__1 I won't buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in "best" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!
__label__1 Non Computer Geek: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER, I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it, after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix, I just got this printer and it is even worse, it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box, the copy was consistantly misaligned. I am sending it back.
__label__1 Curved Thomas the Train tracks: Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones.
__label__1 O-o-okay: Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she'll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!
__label__2 Heads above the first book in the trilogy: I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book.
__label__2 Good book: I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history.
__label__2 Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan.
__label__2 Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change.
__label__1 Good politics, but no science: The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.
__label__2 Asimow is one of the best writers of all times: Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books.
__label__2 Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!
__label__1 Don't Bother: Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish.
__label__1 tough going: I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!
__label__1 Dissatified: I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story.
__label__1 Goes "Haywire" Regularly: Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!
__label__2 Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it.
__label__1 Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
__label__1 worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!
__label__1 Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2.
__label__1 LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
__label__1 What did I watch?: So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
__label__2 Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?
__label__2 If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land ("Welcome to Mongolia!" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.
__label__1 Banal and Boring: No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say "nearly," because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...
__label__2 GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
__label__2 Amazing Score.: Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!
__label__1 Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it.
__label__2 Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
__label__1 It's too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of "dummie" and "KISS" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste.
__label__2 Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.
__label__1 awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
__label__2 Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.
__label__1 Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called "classic" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me.
__label__2 entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
__label__2 one more positive note: Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.
__label__1 Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue.
__label__2 This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as "The Road Warrior." And "The Road Warrior" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today."Mad Max" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the "action hero" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.
__label__2 Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'
__label__1 AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!
__label__2 Oh, my God! It's Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song "Revolution 9" from the "White Album." I could've just imagined while listening to "Baby Lulu" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)
__label__2 Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!
__label__2 Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
__label__2 Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!
__label__2 Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
__label__2 Well Played Kid's Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own.
__label__1 Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!
__label__2 well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn't put it down! if u haven't read it yet, do so!
__label__1 Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
__label__2 Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual "guide." The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!
__label__2 These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, "Merrills are a hug for the feet." Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them.
__label__2 Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.
__label__2 Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
__label__2 You'll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc.
__label__2 Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of "Lament" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song "Beuonos Aires" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.
__label__2 EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
__label__1 Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.
__label__2 A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.
__label__1 A small leak, right out of the box: I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this.
__label__1 Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed.
__label__2 It's a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it's firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties.
__label__2 Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.
__label__2 comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone.
__label__1 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
__label__2 Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
__label__2 Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.
__label__1 Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years.
__label__1 It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress.
__label__1 Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality.
__label__2 Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.
__label__1 WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM.
__label__1 Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is "save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on", that's what we're doing now.
__label__2 Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!
__label__1 Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.
__label__2 Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
__label__2 Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.
__label__2 Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.
__label__2 Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn't have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn't get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it's very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate.
__label__2 Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
__label__2 Its better then a "normal" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.
__label__1 Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
__label__2 Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.
__label__2 great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
__label__1 Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.
__label__1 Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.
__label__2 The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
__label__2 Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.
__label__2 Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!
__label__2 Step's Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD "Standing Room Only." "I'm So Glad" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a "must buy" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.
__label__2 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn't get the best air so I'd recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]
__label__2 DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
__label__1 Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
__label__2 good: It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!
__label__1 Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY
__label__1 No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
__label__1 Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.
__label__2 GREAT prodct: For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.
__label__1 Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.
__label__1 Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.
__label__1 Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the "bunny ears" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product.
__label__1 HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum "my first vibrator" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more "lifted" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!
__label__2 After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.
__label__1 I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.
__label__2 Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
__label__2 Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her "dialouges" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like "Evergreen" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), "The Music of the Night" , & "Somewhere" (not favorable with Il Divo)
__label__1 Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...
__label__1 misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the "too good to be true" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.
__label__2 Pendulum Magic for Beginners: This was a fabulous book to read. It contained so much information. I enjoyed every chapter. I make Porcelain Pendulums so to have this wonderful book on hand was an absolute bonus.
__label__2 Good product: Low foaming product that cleans very well. Easy to use and rinses clean away. Camco hasn't let me down for anything yet.
__label__2 if you liked the movie: if you are a fan of man on fire you will enjoy owning this soundtrack. its moving, alot of electronica, some spanish music and some very moving pieces.
__label__1 Movie sound better: This is not the movie soundtrack..where's the beautiful classical guitar track and the one at the end with that girl singing all soft and stuff, is that Lisa Gerrard...and wher'es the Nine Inch Nails "The Mark has Been Made"? that was in the movie... but all the music in the movie was brilliant and haunting..this is crap...
__label__1 Eeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!: I am a big fan of 80s music, next to country. They totally ruined some of my favorite songs. They were by people you don't even know. They totally ruined one of my favorite songs, ''Karma Chameleon'' by Boy George!!!!!! They totally ruined ''Billy Jean'' and ''Time After Time.'' The original artists would say ''EEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''
__label__1 BEST OF THE 80'S: VERY UNHAPPY TO HEAR AWFUL IMITATION IF THE 80'S....GOT TAKEN...WATCH OUT FOR "PERFORMED BY COUNTDOWN SINGERS" BY MADACY ENTERTAINMENT. I DONT KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T CLICK THAT IT MAY NOT BE ORIGINAL ARTISTS. ONCE YOU BREAK THE SEAL IT'S YOURS. YOU HAVE TO READ THE SMALL PRINT...ALWAYS
__label__1 Does not light up to promise: While the dragonfly stake is pretty, we are very disappointed that it does not live up to the product description which says that it glows in the dark, our main reason for making the purchase. We placed the stake in the sunniest part of our garden, which has sun all morning and day long, and it does not glow at all. We also purchased the butterfly stake, and it unfortunately does not glow in the dark either.
__label__2 30 years and going stong: This is a dear little book and was my daughter's favorite as a child. I love the old fashioned line drawings and the charming baby (she looks like a toddler) inside her mama. There's nothing terribly realistic about it, but it's a fun jumping off place for your child's own birth story. The book is also available as a softcover with color illustrations, but I think it's worth hunting down the vintage copies. Unlike some of the contemporary children's books, this one has a plot with enough drama to engage and a twist to delight. My daughter is grown now, and I'm giving this book to the moms in her generation.
__label__2 Great Stuff: I have pretty crappy skin genetics, so I have problems with ingrown hairs and clogged pores all the time. A common misconception is being dirty, but I shower daily and it makes no difference. I tried body scrubs, lotions, creams and peroxide and just nothing has seemed to work or help. My sister suggested I try this No Bump stuff because she has the same problems with her skin like I do. I was really surprised when I got it, because after a few days of application, my skin was clearing up, and I was having less issues. Now I will say, it does not completely clear up the blemishes, but it makes shaving so much easier and my legs don't have as many red bumps anymore. I like it.
__label__1 Cannot Recommend: I used this vacuum for the first time today and was fairly pleased with it until I broke it while trying to put it away.Update: Electrolux sent me a new power head attachment free of charge. That one broke too. It is unacceptable for a $300-$400 vacuum to be so flimsy. This vacuum is cheaply made and should have a price that reflects that.
__label__1 very disappointed: Bought this vacuum from amazon five months ago, it's already died. Really expected more from electrolux - I'd never buy another one. The bag inside is awfully small, so it really doesn't hold much. I've got 2 cats, and it did a fair job of cleaning, but the vacuum head is pretty large and bulky and it wasn't anywhere near as good as the miele that it replaced, which managed to last for 6 years. Awfully disappointed in this vacuum.
__label__1 Heavy yet fragile!: This was reviewed well by Consumer Reports but (1) is very expensive, (2) very heavy to use, and (3) fragile - the nozzle broke after a few uses. I would not buy this again!
__label__2 A quiet little sucker: I bought the 7020B and really like the suction and portability. I have had no problems with it.The good aspects:*great suction on low pile carpets and floors.*QUIET* light weight & easily portable/maneuverable* controls on the handle, long cord, long wandThe downsides:* doesn't work well on shag carpets; not all the attachments are on-board* pricey bags
__label__2 Electrolux: This is the quietest vacuum cleaner. I've only used it a few times, but so far it is great. My one complaint is that I can't find a place to carry the upholstery tool on the machine.
__label__1 omg, im so mad: for one, somewhere in the discription you could have put that you had to build it, it doesnt really work, and it looks nothing like the picture on display!! The colors aren't even the same! I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1 Excellent concept, but a failed project: I am an avid supporter of female athletes. That is why I decided to give Mia Hamm Soccer 64 a try. Unfortunately, unlike Mia Hamm, this game falls very short in execution: the controls are stiff, the announcer (with all due respect to Wendy) is too repetative, the graphics have a very low polygon count, and every athlete looks the same except for skin color. I admire South Peak Interactive for making what is apparently the second sports video game to star a woman (the first is Jennifer Capriatti Tennis for Sega Genesis), but they should have done more to make this game fun to play. Here's hoping they try again, but this time REALLY TRY.
__label__1 Replacement cap: The replacement cap for the 'lightweight' vaughan hammer is a great idea, However, the hammer is too heavy to be touting itself as a lightweight hammer. I will keep mine to use for demolition and concrete work.
__label__2 see blue: i am arash afrasiabi and i had red this book before i think it is really a good guide for specially industrial designers who want to start their job in this fild so and it can help you to manage your self and your project very well.
__label__1 Not as advertised: Oh it’s a sphere alright, that’s where what was shipped and what is shown in the pictures separate ways. If you need an ugly 3/4 in. sphere, this is your product, if you are looking for a shiny "Brass Ball” move on. Also, is it just me or are prime shipping times just a fantasy? Rarely are things shipped when they say they will be, or it changes just after the order is placed.
__label__2 Almost A Vigilante: Pronzini's nameless detective is by his own admission very much in his own likeness. Nameless is a big Italian who drinks beer, smokes a lot and collects pulp magazines. Pronzini claims that his hero also has the author's same personality and values. Nameless is Pronzini if Pronzini was a private detective.Nameless verges on becoming the vigilante while working on this case, but he catches himself in time. He also operates outside the law by practicing without a license, witholding evidence, breaking and entering, and failing to report a homicide.
__label__1 Not What I Expected from Liz: I am a huge fan of Liz Gillies but this DVD did not hold my interest at all. It seemed rushed in sections and she was frequently off-beat with the music she chose. Some of the moves were similar to those in her Progressive Pilates series but not as effective, in my opinion. She doesn't cue as well as she usually does. I really wanted to enjoy this one but unfortunately I can't. The bonus section was okay but just a tease. Just when you really start to enjoy the toning, the session is done. Well, I will just continue to use and enjoy her Progressive Pilates DVD's until she comes out with something else worthwhile.
__label__2 what's up dudes: I think that this book is really awesome because I read the hole thing yesterday and it is so good and just packed with cheat codes.
__label__1 SOME of the BEST (at best....): Submitted for your perusal, a list of songs NOT included on this "VERY BEST" compilation: "CONTROVERSY," "DIRTY MIND," "I FEEL 4 U," "WHEN U WERE MINE," "SOFT AND WET," "DELIRIOUS," "TAKE ME WITH U," "POP LIFE," "MOUNTAINS," "IF I WAS YOUR LOVER," "BATDANCE," "7," "THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD." Fortunately, one can opt for "THE HITS/B-SIDES" (1993). Maybe this was released as a mere refresher course. But one cannot properly honor Prince's nearly-25-year carreer without AT LEAST issuing a double-disc. This should have been titled, "PRINCE -- A SAMPLER."
__label__1 RIP-OFF: This is not even close to a good representation of Prince's best and was release without his approval.
__label__1 Lets Forget This: 80"s Crap.Prince sings hits for the light in the loafers crowd. Deep six this for a Beatles album or some Zappa if you dare.
__label__1 It's great that it includes "Money Don't Matter 2 Night": But it's definitely worth passing by. For the best Prince "Best Of" experience, get Hits 1 and 2, and Hits + B-Sides. A lot of great stuff is left out here, making this ideal only for the casual fan.
__label__1 Older music is better: Nothing from 'Dirty Mind' or 'Controversy'? That's supposed to be a selling point?
__label__2 Good Concept - Solid performance for money: This might be a premature review since I have been using the unit for a week. The pros I like-- cheap-- compact size, small as a walkman-- can be used as an extra drive to carry/store your docs-- volume is ok. I don't know why people complain. Buy a new set of headphones since the ones it comes with is pretty useless.The cons are-- resume function after unit shutdown for shuffle feature is available only if u install firmware 5.0-- volume up and down should be +,- if hold for a long time, it is a pain finding the on button and hitting the +,- at the same time.-- case it comes with is useless. No acc. to the buttons is available. Should be a transparent case-- it does skip, not often but every once in a while so not recommended for jogging.-- Full battery charge takes at least 8 hours. A faster solution should be available.-- long term stability unknownI am on firmware 4.54a.
__label__2 Still runs like a champ....: I've used my Jukebox 6000 almost everyday since June, and it's been everything i hoped it would be. I mostly use it in my car with the casette deck attachment, but I've been able to apply other practical uses for it. I can upload any of my favorite .mp3s to my friends' PCs/Macs. It serves as a walkman and storage for large files when I'm on the road. The Jukebox is not only limited to music file storage (which is the case with the bulky NOMAD). I've used it to store large mpegs, software installation files, and hard drive backups so I could avoid burning CDs, and lugging around my laptop on some business trips.With the latest BIOS updates, this puppy seems to run longer too... If you're trying to decide between the Nomad and the Jukebox...... Jukebox all the way! No Contest.
__label__1 I returned the piece of junk!: Cheap construction .. the battery covers are flimsy, and I though I was going to break it trying to get the batter covers off. But that's not the worst of it, expect horrible battery Life: about 2 hours on a full charge! AND, you can ONLY use the batteries that they supply with it, even though they are DOUBLE AA size! The fact that it will not work with other double A batteries seems a horrible design flaw.I think it's only good as a repository for files or MP3's, but as a practical listening device it's not very good, in my opinion. Supplied headphones are cheap and don't sound good. It doesn't appear that it has an optional car hookup power supply, which renders it nearly useless to me (with the abysmal 2 hours battery life). Others rated it high, but I don't see it. On the plus side, it's easy to use (and transfer files, with USB interface) and can store any file, not just MP3's.
__label__1 Coolest looking paper weight ever: I bought one used and its great for keeping paper on your desk but thats about it. The main problem is that it doesn't turn on. Kind of hard to listen to mp3's when you player doesn't turn on. I wrote an email to tech support so we'll see how that goes. (...)
__label__2 Almost perfect is right: Overall, I am very impressed with the device. I am planning to buy one for my brother as a gift.Likes 1. Small size 2. Very eay to use - I had to get used to navigate the directories with main button but once I figured out it was very easy. 3. Easy file tranfer and quick transfer from CD to MP3. 4. Capacity of the hard drive (it is quite too) 5. Cool apearancedon't likes 1. Battery access - it is very challeging. I hope I do not have to change batteries often but it would be nice if it was easy 2. Headphone - the headphone sounds very cheap 3. loose feeling of the main button and a loud clicking sound it makes everytime you press it. 4. Volume control - to adjust volume you have to go into the menuWish list 1. Remote control with LCD display like Sony
__label__1 How about some quality control???: I've had problems with the power coming on (Yes, I know to hold the button down, but it doesn't come on unless it's USB cord is plugged in).Even after properly allowing the batteries to fully charge and the like, every recharge takes hours upon hours. should i have to charge for 8 hours to get 8 hours of play? I don't think so.I have contacted customer support, but no response yet. All my problems seemed to happen after downloading a firmware upgrade.Though it may be subjective, I just dont have a good feeling about the player/company. If they fail to send an idea to fix it(it's been 3 weeks already), I'm returning it to Amazon. This was great at first, but the whole "NOT WORKING" thing kind of put a rain on my parade.Just spend a bit more and insure your happiness.
__label__1 Product Defective, No Tech Support: I received my Jukebox, spent hours copying all of my music into the hard drive, and it worked for approximately 10 days. Now the screen on the Archos is frozen, and since my computer won't recogize it as a drive it has rendered the Archos as the most expensive paperweight I have ever bought.I have tried to call Archos during business hours (nobody answers), after hours (voice mail was full), and email (three in two weeks with no response). I'm not really sure this company even exists. It would be a very cool product if it worked.
__label__1 A worthless little thing: This device has one task to handle: provide radio reception.It fails. Reception is awful, noisy; moving an inch requires an adjustment. ...
__label__1 Fradulent Product: We ordered based on the website photo and we got totally different product. I am not sure about the credibility of this organization
__label__1 Did Not work: i had bought this has a X-Mas gift and was shock that it did not work. Because I waited so long to return it I had to pay for the freight to return it.
__label__2 my dad loves this flashlight: No batteries needed. It does take a while to get going but after you shake it, a lot, it works great.
__label__2 best cd ever: stroke 9 has put out some good stuff on a cd but i have never liked a hole cd this much i think its the best cd i have heard evere if u like maroon 5, green day, and john mayer then this cd is for u
__label__2 Nice affordable rack: This rack gets the job done. I mostly use it for local trips (under 10 miles) so I can't speak to its performance over long distances, but for what I do it's perfect.Getting it set up each time can be a bit tedious, and the center rack-to-bike strap usually comes loose, but other than that no real complaints. It scratched up my trunk paint the first time I used it because I didn't offset it from the car enough, definitely be careful about that.Considering the price of most bike racks out there, this is a VERY good buy for your money at less than half the price of others.
__label__2 We Approach Our Martini's: "We Approach Our Martinis with Such High Expectations," has presented us with yet another format for surf literature: the slide show. Jamie Brisik narrates the adventure in a voice dripping with texture to tell us that surfing is about more than what happens in the water. It is also about what happens between the sheets, between disappointment and triumph, and between man and God. Brisick's crisp lens brings to focus the smelly details no matter where they might lead him. All the varied scenes managed to fall into an expression of the more fragile side of the human condition. He voices a challenge to everyone and seems to be more sympathetic to the places and experiences he had than to any audience. This conversational read was done in a voice only earned through years seriously searching for the answers to timeless questions. Though not offering concrete answers, the poetry reveals that it is not for a lack of reflection.
__label__2 well done: Could a boy falling from the sky be a more appropriate cover for a book that reads more like a diary confession than the average book you find on the shelves... ? Jamie Brisick has achieved a personal height here. I read his work in Surfing magazine for years which was average and moderately entertaining. His book comes from the heart. A hundred times deeper than previous texts. This book is like a perfect blueprint for anyone wanting interested in communicating the journey into the interior. Well done.
__label__2 From the Belly of the Beast: Short stories on the worst Rome has to offer. A little boy gets raped and killed. Two Albanian teenagers sold into Italian Prostitution. In Africa, a nun is raped by Muslim bandits. We get inside an insane asylum, hear about the abuse by a father, and ever so much more. In all the stories we see Police Commissioner Adele Sofia at work, at times helped by Inspector Marra.The stories are devastating because they ring so true. The author writes straight forward, not losing any time on asides or descriptions. Brute crimes, basic language.
__label__1 I was wrong in my previous review.: I recommended this work earlier (A reader from Everett, WA)I have been forced to reconsider my opinions on this work and on the Dake Annotated Reference Bible as well. Dake is the godfather of modern day Pentecostal-Latter Rain-Toronto Vineyard Teachings, and cannot be recommended except as a reference to Bleeding Edge Pentecostal errors.I retract my recommendation and apologize for leading astray.For more information on these works try a search engine with Dake and Heresy.
__label__1 Conessions of a Prima Donna: Wow! Have you ever read a book that is just so unbelievably full of itself that you are continiously shaking your head in amazement?>This is THAT book. If you'd like to read how wonderful and clever Anne Modesitt is, buy this book. If you expect to learn anything about knitting-buy any other book BUT this one.
__label__1 Horrible service: The item did not arrive. Also the mode of shipment was deceptive. It was shipped via FedEx but then transferred to the USPS. Obviously, using two different types of shipping facilities will increase inefficiency and loss of purchase. If Amazon had been explicit about how the book would have been shipped, then I would not have purchased the item. Very disappointing. Barnes and Noble will be the optional choice to meet my needs.
__label__2 Music truly is the best lover: An intensely soulful combination of Bjork and Tori Amos, Elisa boasts talent and intensity that can only send her straight to the top. Track one of "Asile's World" had me so hooked that I bought the CD on the spot -- and I don't speak a word of Italian. Her intense, almost unearthly voice can rival that of a Siren, and non-Italian speakers need not fear -- 15 out of 16 tracks on this CD are in English. Solid, beautifully arranged and well executed -- this is definitely one not to be missed.
__label__2 Polished Christmas Blues: A nice collection of Christmas (and New Years') tunes, arranged and performed in polished blues style. King's fans will love this, as will anyone who is looking for something a bit different than Bing Crosby, The Carpenters, et al. King remakes an earlier Christmas song (Christmas Celebration), which he originally cut for the Kent label, and which can be found on some budget comps, sometimes titled "Celebrate Christmas."Mood-wise, King's playing is mostly slow or mid-tempo, so this will mix well with mellower, jazzier things, too. In fact, a nice appendage to this set would be a song done by Chris Cain in the King style - "The Little Drummer Boy Meets B.B."(It originally appeared on Cain's 1999 release, "Christmas Cain - Blues For The Holidays").
__label__1 I returned it back: I have a poodle which I purchased this dryer to groom her myself at home, I was not able to use the dryer since the loud noise would freak her out!.. i returned the unit in exchange for a 2hp b-air power dryer which turned out to be more powerful than the metro 4hp version.. how is that possible?
__label__1 Not Very Good: I'm no yo-yo pro, but I think I can safely say that this one is not very good. It feels cheap compared to other yo-yos I have used plus its spin time is terrible. I can't seem to get it to sleep for more than 5 or 6 second. The weighting feels a little off and the sidecaps look really cheap. My friend has a Speed Beetle and it is a much better yo-yo at a similar price. I'd go ahead and skip this one.Dragonfly Yo-yo
__label__1 When Stupid People Get Book Deals.: Wow. I never thought I'd get a chance to write a negative review of a book, because my ability to pick personal winners has served me so well in the past. However, I caught this hardcover on sale and now I know why it was so cheap: it's terrible.The format is basic: a dilemma, one or more tips, and a solution. Some of these dilemmas are so obvious that you wonder if the 'smart people' in the title is just a trap for large egos.The tips are likewise obvious and of little help, but the maddening solutions cement my opinion. There is nothing written about how the solution actually worked in reality, so the reader is left to wonder if the dopey tips or solutions were of any use or not.If I wrote this, I'd be embarassed. In fact, I'm embarassed about reading it, but since it's now part of the bathroom reading material (no more perfect venue than that), it makes for a good laugh or two.
__label__2 MOTOWN 1970s - Vol. 2: I specifically purchased this CD because the long version of Stoned Love, by the Supremes, is on it, and I had been searching for it for many years! It's my favorite song on the CD. To the person searching for the long version of Stoned Love, you'll find it on this CD.
__label__2 Entertaining "up" and "down": As an earlier reviewer mentioned, there are a few typos (or mistakes), but do not let this stop you from buying this book. It is an excellent read. Miller discusses his current view on the game of golf. He is very candid in his discussion and pulls no punches -- he feels that Tiger is older than he really is and because of this, his dominance in the sport will quickly diminish.I felt the best part of the book was his detailed discussion on introducing your children to the game of golf. If you have kids and want to educate them on golf, read this book. He discusses the great influence that his father had on him while growing up and how this made him a better person and a better golfer. If more than anything, I came away feeling that Johnny Miller is an excellent parent/father to his children.
__label__2 Great Book - may not be a good fit for you: I thought this book was very well written and could be immensely helpful for individuals starting their life on wheels. The book contains answers to questions you never would have thought to ask and covers all sorts of topics...even Zen wheeling! However, this book may not be the most appropriate book for all individuals in a wheelchair, as the book is geared towards individuals who have spinal cord injuries.
__label__1 My Opinion: I was very disappointed in this book. It was not current enough and much of the information was older and not as relevant as I had hoped.
__label__1 Don't bother: This product is a piece of crap. It didn't pick up much and it's too much of a hasstle to pull out everytime you want to clean up a mess.
__label__1 Not up to Square's Quality.....: Secret of Evermore is a beginner game. I spent of most my time Powering up weapons and the alchemy spells which you aquire. It's really bad. I am an Avid player of Squares w/ Final Fantasies, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Vagrant Story, Parasite Eve, etc....And My final Conclusion of this game is that -- it was put together in a hurry. It's that bad.
__label__1 Poorly written...next time hire a fact checker: Although I feel sorry for the author being shot with no chance to defend himself, the bulk of this book is a polemic attack on the firearms industry. Now that's to be expected from a typical NYer and a victim, but what is most troubling about the book is the factual inaccuracies, particularly about the history of firearms development in the US. The author tries to smear arms manufacturers as racists and incorrectly draws parallels to Nazi Germany. Next time hire a fact checker and maybe even someone with a mere high school education will take this book halfway serious.
__label__1 Never buy an Atkins Book: Dr. Atkins, I use Dr. loosely, should stop writing books. He assume the reader knows to much. Also, Dr. Atkins should stay in his own realm of chemistry, Physical chemistry and not try to intrude into other areas. Avoid this book like the plague. Atkins writes only to write them and get a fat check. The content is sub-par.
__label__1 Just okay: I first saw Jaguar Wright on Jay Z's Unplugged show and thought she was a star in the making. The subsequent hype made me eager to hear more. Unfortunately, this CD doesn't live up to the excitement. Jaguar is undoubtedly talented but her music would have been more effective without the cursing. I just don't think excessive swearing works in R&B especially.I have to say I found some unexpected hilarity in the most hostile CD/album liner notes I've ever read, but at the same time it made me sad. Wright has potential but there seem to be some, uh, "issues." Hopefully she reaches a level of maturity that's equal to her talent.
__label__1 Stopped working after 10 minutes: Well they sounded great...for the 10 minutes that they worked.The sound cut out mid-song playback. Several hours of web surfing later, I see this is a problem that many users have had.My system successfully detects the speakers, the power is functional, the drivers are loaded, the sound routes to the speakers, and according to windows hardware testing playback is functional. However, sound is no longer coming out of the speakers. Other speakers and built in speaker are all functional.I will be returning these. Logitech customer support is weak. Disappointing, since the speakers sounded decent to my non-audiophile ears - for the 1.5 songs that they were able to play.
__label__2 Great Speakers for any laptop: These speakers are a God-send for anyone looking to beef up their tiny and crappy notebook speakers. I carry them whenever I know im going to need my laptop for a couple of hours somewhere other than home.Very convenient case and no power requirements other than the USB is also great. Its recognized in almost all my different computers and laptops.The reason for a star being knocked off is the fact that turning up the volume all the way creates some weird static noises. Tune it down just a bit and it works great though, and these things are LOUD.
__label__2 Lots of bang for the buck: I am really impressed with the quality and dimension these little speakers offer. I was looking for a set of portable speakers for my Gateway NV52 series laptop. These fit the bill perfectly. Not a lick of trouble installing, true plug and play. Comes with a durable carrying case which just adds to the value. Volume output is plenty loud if that's your game. Great product.
__label__2 Good for home, not for my classroom: I was really excited to receive these speakers. I am a teacher and have the technology to run movies, etc. through my laptop, but needed more sound than the small laptop speaker provided. I really liked the Logitech V20 Notebook speakers. They were small, and the carrying case would make is very easy to travel between work and home. The price was absolutely fantastic.I tried the speakers out at home, and was pleased with the sound. However, when I used them in my classroom, they just were not powerful enough. I was disappointed they did not give me the sound I needed in my classroom, as everything else about the speakers were top notch. I returned these speakers, and just received the Dell WL6000 120v speakers. Definitely not as portable as the Logitech, but much more powerful.If you are looking for a compact set of speakers to use on the road in a hotel room or other small room, the Logitech speakers would be an excellent choice.
__label__2 Two years old and going strong: I needed a pair of speakers to go with my laptop (iBook G4) and I didn't want the hassle of an extra AC adapter, and these speakers fit the bill. Some of my friends have cute portable speakers that are very small, but the sound suffers accordingly (especially when they obliviously push them far beyond their capabilities). These may be larger than some portable speaker sets, but they sound great and the carrying case is super handy. My major beef with these speakers, though is the cabinet design. Certain resonant low-end frequencies cause the speakers to buzz and walk across my desk. It's annoying on two levels.Somewhat related: There's something funky with Mac's DVD Player app: Loud sounds in movies will cause the sound level to drop drastically and then gradually come back to the set level. I thought using the USB output might mitigate the problem, but this is the case whether I'm using the speaker output or the USB port. FWIW.
__label__1 Low Sound Quality: The speakers look great in the web-site, but the sound quality is the opposite. When I turned the volume high, the speakers were shaking and producing very bad quality sound. So appereance might be deceptive...
__label__2 read together: We read this book, a chapter at a time, as a family and enjoyed the experience. My son liked Hamid's determination and my daughter identified with Jenny, the spoiled rich girl, who changed into a caring child. As parents, we enjoyed exposing our family to the way God provides for those who lean on Him.
__label__1 Strong Vinyl Smell: The product pictures do not show the LARGE plastic warning label that is sewn (can't rip off) on the blue flap. It smells very strong like vinyl plastic. Something that smells this BAD can't be good. Yikes! I used a Snuggle Nest with my first child and thought I could save a little $$ by getting this similar product for my second child. Bad idea.
__label__1 Poor Quality: I loved this product when I first got it. Of course, with a baby, you are going to have to clean it at some point. When the time came, I followed the care directions for washing the mat cover. Unfortunately, it was ripped to shreds and could not be repaired. I contacted the company about the flaw but never got a response.
__label__1 Not safe: I like that the sides are sturdy and it would be impossible to roll over on baby. It also folds up nicely for traveling.Problem #1 is that everytime the baby woke me up, he would be hanging out of the sleeper from the waist down. I never could figure out what was happening, but he would turn sideways and slip out. Also, the bottom half of this is not level with the top half,I think that may have caused the problem. This worried me too much, so after spending $40 I put it away with only 2 weeks of use.Problem #2, my baby was only 19" and it was almost too small for him. There's no room for a baby to grow.
__label__1 Only good for a month at most...: I ordered The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper for an upcoming trip with my 2 month old baby. My baby is 22 inches long and 9 lbs. This sleeper would probably only last this one trip as her feet already touch the foot bumper. Also, the netting on the end by her feet is not secure at all. It is flimsy. It has a nice and padded mattress though, which seems very comfortable. It seems like it would be great for a newborn, but not something you could plan on using for a long time.
__label__2 Awesome travel sleeper!: My son loves this travel sleeper. It is perfect for sleeping SAFELY in the bed with baby while away from home. It is also great for sitting on the floor and using as a changing station. I've used it a lot since this is my family's first grandchild (we are going over to Grandma and Grandpa's a lot!). The only warning is that the sleeper is 24" and the baby could outgrow it fast. Our son was born at 20" so he will fit in it fine for good while. The sleeper even has storage pockets and folds up nicely for traveling. Buy this sleeper and you won't regret it!
__label__1 Help the environment: Recycle this book: This book is not even worth the price of paper it's printed on.Cal Thomas just keeps yapping and yapping incoherently while contradicting himself in many places. Cal Thomas alienates his readers by actually accusing them of ignorance.Cal please come down from your high horse.Save yourself some money, there is no wit or wisdom here !!
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS: Well to make a long story short and many e-mails to magix, they are unable to tell me why their Mp3 maker program does not make mp3s. All other programs that I have tried work fine such as Windows media player, itunes and many others but their program is a piece of junk and I will never waist my money on any Magix product again. I'm still waiting for them to give me my money back. I'll stay with itunes, it was free and works great. Please take my advice, after trying 2 magix products that didn't work, I've had enough of this. just read all the blogs and you will hear the same stuff.
__label__1 Sad collection: It is ashame that this book was even published. It is full of typo errors. The stories, etc. don't connect. Anyone who knows or have been to the Abbey know that this book does injustice to this sacred place. Fr.Timothy's eulogies are the only redeeming part of the book.
__label__2 Great for little kids to take with them!!: This little album is perfect and small enough for kids to fill with pictures of family members, favorite pet, classmates... Sturdy and practical ( clip hook) Very cute.
__label__2 Gummy Pizza: Amazon told me I had to contact the company to cancel my order. I want to thank the company, The Online Candy Shop. They were very helpful and understanding of my situation. They did not give me a hard time about cancelling my order, they just took care of it. This is one of the best experiences I have had online. Thanks so much.
__label__1 Wrong Item: If you are going to be sending the American version of Shutter, please have it listed under the AMERICAN Shutter's listing. I was hoping for the foreign one with American subtitles because it is actually much better than the pathetic one with the kid from Dawson's Creek in it, but unfortunately that is not what I received, but I didn't have access to the post office until recent so I was unable to return it to get what I was supposed to order. Oh well.
__label__2 Mackays best book to date: I have been a fan of Harvey Mackay since reading Swim with the Sharks. Pushing the Envelope is even better.If you are in business or want to be, read this book and learn from a master..
__label__2 It will become a classic soon: The artist and the writer have made a high quality comic. Action is overflowing, but it never lets the story get lost. Sixteen century Japan is depicted in its full glory and detail but without imposible romanticism or longing. The characters are clearly described, both by the script and the drawing. Love, mistery, violence, treason, revenge and politics mingle in a masterwork of so-called "comic". Highly recommendable for comic lovers.
__label__2 Exceptional Thinking: My brother told me about this woman. At a time of crisis, I bought all of her works, and it helped me alot, as she has helped so many others.The concepts are simple, but not many people practice them. Katie has a unique vision of this world, and if you listen, you will learn, and come away a bit more empowered.
__label__2 do the work & be free: Katie takes you through "The Work" step by step. If you're willing to do the work, then you will transform your life & you'll operate from a higher place & that's true happiness.
__label__2 She's amazing: This CD book is wonderful. Byron Katie is such a blessing to all who will allow her into their lives. Enjoy...I did!!!!
__label__2 This game is awesome, but one problem: This game is a ton of fun. I've played it at a friend's house. But when I received it, many pieces were missing and some of the countries had too many instead. So it was impossible to play as is with the missing pieces. That was the only problem I had. I did not contact the seller just because it got away from me. Had it had the correct pieces, I would have given it 5 stars.
__label__2 Academia brought to the real world: Having read books like IN SEARCH OF EXCELLENCE and teadiously gone through the academic minutia, this book has brought it to the real world. I could NOT put this one down. I am glad someone finally put it in such a format that folks can read without having to weed through the technical mumbo jumbo
__label__1 Mr. Skaggs makes a wrong turn.: Mr. Skaggs made reference to my novel, SEARCHING FOR BLANCHE, with a condescending nod to the problem of agoraphobia. How could my character ride a train from Atlanta to New Orleans when she could barely leave the house, he asked. If he'd read a little further Mr. Skaggs would have learned that she left in the company of her best friend and constant companion, Mister Vodka. Kept hidden in her purse in a bottle of Scope, Mister Vodka provided comfort and solace. Until she meets a certain cabbie named Art.
__label__2 tells it like it is: some would say bruce who! when it comes to music. But those people that have heard any of his music know what to expect. this is some of his older stuff from the 80's. At times it shows it's age but is still great. Any die hard Willis fans will love it. My fave is jackpot, a fine tune to get go going in the morning. Buy, listen and enjoy.
__label__1 Awful device: Don't waste your money on one of these. The transfer rate is nothing like what is claimed. I have other USB hard drives and flash thumb drives that all work great, but this Samsung device is the pits.Here's a real example:7 minutes to copy 50 Mb. That's about 125kbps. It's laughable that in the literature they claim 'up to' 480MBps.I'd give it zero stars if it could. Like another reviewer, I got sent this after ordering a Seagate through an Amazon seller. I ended up using Amazon's A-Z guarantee to get my money back. This item is trash.
__label__1 surreal (but others in the series seem better): I found this in the mystery section at the library and figured someone with this many published books in a series must be pretty good... Then I tried to read it and wondered if this is one of those modern surreal novels where everything seems like a dream where strange people with strange names do strange things for no reason. (The description of one of the local drivers reminds me of a dream I once had, and trying to get though this book seemed like a nightmare.) There was a mystery somewhere in there because there was a denouement at the end but most of it seemed to be comedy of the absurd. (It did have recipes but they were trying to force themselves to fit the grape theme and most of them seemed as bizarre and surreal as the plot.)Fortunately I'd gotten two books from the library and the other was much more comprehensible so this particle volume seems to be an anomaly (like the author had a fever while trying to write it.)
__label__2 Simpler show from a simpler time..: The good guy gets the girl in the end of this fun movie which is very mild by 2012 standards.
__label__2 great find: This movie is so good for all ages and especially those who grew up with Don Knotts. Very funny and heart warming and a joy to have on hand for a rainy or snowy day to make you and the kids laugh! Who can not laugh at "Barney Fife"!
__label__2 Don Knotts at his best! Nervous as ever.: A cult movie in my opinion. This movie has the kind of emotions that made Don Knotts a legend, and its suitable for the whole family! How rare is that?!
__label__2 Atta Boy, Luther!: Number one on my list of classic comedies. Don Knotts cracks me up in this movie and the music is just as lovable as the quirky faces of Don Knotts.
__label__2 Best old campy movie ever: Don Knotts is brilliant in this old early '70's era show, his timing is fantastic, and he plays the part unbelievably well. My kids and I watch it several times every Halloween and quote it all the time. It is so funny!!
__label__1 A warning to potential students: I too have found that this book is full of 'issues' that make learning ODEs not only a chore, but next to impossible. The problems presented in the book make little sense to anyone except for the profs. If you are planning on teaching an ODE course with this book, I beg you to reconsider your choice of books for the sake of your students.
__label__2 Loving it!: Fresh made whip cream, yes please! This product is amazing! It's simple, easy to use, and great for dessert and drinks!
__label__2 Great tool.: With the advent of more percise measurements needed for rear drums on many SUVs, this tool is a necessity, and at a great price.
__label__1 Flimsy Handle: I, like others, liked the processor at first. However, after a few months the plastic on the handle of the bowl broke. The processor doesn't work unless the bowl latches, but if the handle is cracked or busted, it doesn't latch. So, I bought a replacement bowl for around $30, and it broke, too, after only two uses. I am over it. Very frustrated with the poor, flimsy quality of the bowl.
__label__1 Cheap. Save your money: The handle on the bowl broke off. I called KA they told me I bought it in August (I didn't I bought it in nov for a Christmas gift). KA argued with me! After I produced a receipt they told me they'd replace the crappy plastic bowl. How can this be the same Manu of the mixer you can have for 20 years??
__label__1 It broke after a week: The holder broke after a week. It has 6 sections to hold the lids, I could not use all 6 at once. So... what am I going to do with it now?
__label__1 not a useable organizer: Another flop in organizer products. The metal coated ribs that are supposed to hold the lids are very flimsy. One bottom ribs just bent over & the entire item is not usable. Even if it had not been broken, your shelves would need to be set way back to allow for door to close when lids are stored in it.
__label__2 Highly entertaining: I loved this movie. It is loaded with stars all of which are surprisingly funny in their roles. In particular, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda shine in a hilarious episode which really emphasizes their true to life friendship. For sheer entertainment you can't miss with this one.
__label__2 Danigirl loved it !!!: The producer/director definetly scared my pants off. A part II would be really fun.-Danielle in Seattle.
__label__1 Trying to be "edgy," this book is simply offensive: I am by no means a vehement critic of all things David Mitchell--on the contrary, I would count his "Cloud Atlas" as among the best books I have ever read. However, the two books I have read from his beginner days--Ghostwritten and Number 9 Dream--are simply trashy.Both these books, in their quest to be edgy and postmodern, just throw gobs of offensive imagery at the reader. There are extensive references to cheap sex, illegal drug use, and extreme violence. It's a tactic that makes these books glean good reviews on account of the fact they "take risks" or "push the envelope." Don't be fooled by it!Reading "Ghostwritten" or "Number 9 Dream," in my opinion, is little better than watching an episode of "CSI" or "The Sopranos" on television. In other words, this book isn't literature--it's cheap pulp.
__label__1 Not very impressed...: I bought this for my 5 year old, who loves anything princess and anything to do at her desk (notecards, pencils, etc.) She was thrilled to open it Christmas morning but hasn't used it since. The pencil sharpener broke the first time she tried to use it and the tape dispenser is difficult to work. This toy looks cute but is definitely not worth $19.99.
__label__2 Awesome fishing hat! Bite Me!: You can't beat this fishing ball cap for a gift for the fisherman on your list! The Bite Me ball cap is a zillion stitch embroidered, 100% cotton, low profile, top quality hat will a preformed bill.If you know someone who wears one of those goofy "trucker" caps especially with a big T on it, do them a fashion favor and buy them one of Fishboy's low profile fishing hats.
__label__2 Great for the novice glassblower!: The book is very helpful for the beginner who really needs to become familar with the terminology.
__label__2 Back on track!: After the slightly dissapointing "Host" (not so much the fact that is so synthetic, but it was too long and didn't manage to carry itself all the way) I was a bit sceptic over the new single... then I heard it and was completly blown away. The perfect mix of Draconian Times and One Second, melody, riffs and everything was perfect."Sway" sounds a bit like Theatre Of Tragedy's latest, and is not a masterpice, but a good song. "Gone" on the other hand is up there with the best things the band ever done. A calm haunting song that I just can't explain how beautiful it is.The last song, the Mouth mix is just the same song but with a little bit heavier drums... But, Paradise Lost is back, and they prove it with this single!
__label__1 Very bad effort: Google translate would have done a better job in presenting Ghazali's work! I bought this book as it was highly recomended. You could spend an evening reading this without understanding what the imam really meant. Someone should retranslate the corpus into English.
__label__2 I don't know about accurate- but funny!: I am a Romany woman and I will tell you this movie is more of a spoof on Duvall and all the Gadje (non-Gypsies) who believe in stereo-types. There is some reality in this film. Like the Gypsy court system (kris). Which is actually very organised, not like the film would lead you to believe. For us Roma, this is a very funny movie, because of what the Gypsies acting in the movie did! And who couldn't love Angelo Evans!
__label__1 Very Disappointing: I bought these DVDs thinking I would be able to better understand the tack and equipment my Tennessee Walking horses needed to be comfortable and perform at their best. When I called to asked questions about what I saw on the DVD they just referred me back to the DVD, no real answers, no real solutions. The customer service was horrible. It was like now I have your money and you are on your own sister. I will never buy another product from Brenda Imus again.
__label__2 Not very thick jacket: This jacket was very nice an soft fleece, but it is not very thick. My daughter has the light pink-colored version and if she is wearing something dark colored underneath, you can see the pattern. It is does not have a lining on the inside.
__label__2 Decent Hardcore: Everyone says if you like Hatebreed, then you will like this album,Well honestly if you like Hatebreed You'll love this cd. Alot of emotion, catchy choruses and true life problems most can relate too, without using the same riff over, and over again like some so called hardcore bands. With a small following its a shame not to hear more from this band. I enjoy this cd alot, from driving really fast pounding on my steering wheel , to throwing up my fist in the shower, good, true, hardcore.
__label__1 If only Amazon allowed a zero star rating...: This book would get it.What dreck! If by some small chance, after you've read the other reviews posted here and are still thinking about buying this book, slap yourself and move along to the far better choices like eBay for Dummies.The only one in danger of striking it rich with this book is the author, which is frightening.
__label__1 at least I didn't pay full price: I only paid 9.99 for this one because I bought it off of ebay (I'm pretty sure it was used). I should have known better than to buy something with such a catchy title. Boy, was I surprised when it told a newbie like me everything that I already knew.
__label__1 toy not as advertised: This item is listed at being a set of 4 magnetic tops. I ordered 3 sets and got 3 tops. They seemed just fine, though small, but I never opened them because they were definitely NOT worth the price as individual items. Returned them immediately. I was extremely annoyed and disappointed.
__label__1 Wordy: The book was informative but long expanations that are typical of a person with Asperger's Syndrome. It did give me insight to my 33 year old sons sociability. He loves to write research papers. He has a master degree in Human Resourses.
__label__2 Good compilation: I liked the songs selected and enjoyed it very much and much cheaper than buying the tracks for download individually.
__label__2 An amazing testimony: Mrs. Herzberger's very powerful story bears eloquent witness to the innumerable atrocities of the Holocaust and her remarkable resilency and tenacity. It is a testament to her abilities as a writer that we walk through her journey alongside her, all senses and emotions fully engaged. While displays of the worst results of dehumanization occur all around her, Magda retains her dignity and humanity, giving great honor to the memories of those who did not survive. More than a story of survival, her book is a profound spiritual experience about life and living. As groups of people continue to be marginalized, scapegoated and discriminated against today, SURVIVAL reminds us of the ultimate result of such folly. It should be required reading for all political leaders, teachers and students. I greatly admire Mrs. Herzberger for writing this book.Gregory N. Shrader, Ph.D.Psychologist
__label__2 A must read for anyone who cares about the human spirit.: This is not just another book about a Holocaust surviver. It is a book that tears deep to your soul with the facts, feelings and emotions of one that is a true surviver in what many would consider a hopeless strugle. It is a must read for anyone from any ideology. Dr. Moshe Carmilly-Weinberger said it best when he stated that this book needed to be written. And, I would add, it needs to be read.
__label__2 EXCELLENT reading in the BEAUTY SHOP!!!: Blessings!!! Blessings!!! Blessings!!! I started to read this book while I was in the BEAUTY SHOP. I get my hair down weekly so this was the only time I had to read. I must say, reading Blessings while in a Beauty Shop makes the reading much more entertaining. There are 4 women in the shop at Blessings and there are 4 women at the shop where I get my hair done. The personality of Pat, Faye, Zuma and Sandy fit the personalities of the Stylists' at the salon. It was amazing...sad..funny all at the same time. The only bad point in the book was Sandy - and her lost. The question, "why does it take so LONG in the beauty shop?" My answer, I'm glad it does, I was able to finish the book in 3 appointments!!!!
__label__2 Blessings Is A True Pleasure!: 'Blessings' by Sheneska Jackson is most certainly a blessing to read! This enchanting story is based around four women who work at a hair salon in Los Angeles. Pat, the store's owner discovers she is infertile and with the help of her husband, Mark, starts a long and hard journey to adopting a child. Faye, a biracial, widowed, mother of two tries to come to terms with her daughter's wild, reckless ways and a son who will never know his father. Zuma is a hip young woman who's past has come back to haunt her and makes her decide to become pregnant. Finally, there's Sandy, an ex-stripper also called White Chocolate, who's number one passion in life is mistreating her kids. The characters in this story are sympathetic and believable. The plot is also fast-paced and well-planned. There are no boring places in the book so it will certainly keep your attention. If you're reading this review, you've got to get yourself a copy. It is not to be missed!Theresa Harbinger
__label__2 great: my neices loved these, they even used the box as a jewelry box, since they only wear studs. this was a great gift idea.
__label__1 Cheap plastic: I work in hospitality industry and a good wine key is very much appreciated . This is not the case with this one. It is made out of cheap plastic, be aware the name will trick you. Just get Pulltaps and you will not go back.
__label__1 Talk about being suckered!: I played Gamma world when it first came out and it was a huge joy in the fact that if offered more in each book. Detailed maps and indepth scenes were in abundence. When my amazon order for gamma world came in it was almost like the day my Harry Potter book arrived. Yet as I read the entire book I was disappointed since it like the quality and style of the orignal Gamma World, in fact I would like to point out that it is extremely weak since it relies heavily on modern D20 instead on its' own.So for those who bought the book it is a waste of money unless you have money to burn (which they are counting on).I honestly thought about the Gamma world history and why it happen as being lame. Who really cares about nanotech? All the dangers of nuclear, chemical, and bio weapons of mass destruction were reflected highly in the original gamma world. This one is a neutered version! Please do not waste your money!
__label__2 Motown #1s: Apt album title! This album brings back such great memories, can't help but be in a good mood when listening to it. My children who are new to the "oldies" music loved it as much as my husband and I do. GREAT job on the compilation of Motown's #1s!
__label__2 More pickles please....: Is the comments we hear when recipes are used from this book. Great photographs, Great recipes, Great addition to your cookbook library.
__label__1 omg: i hate this phone so much, whatever can go wrong with a cell phone, it will go wrong with this phone!
__label__1 Recording Quality Ruins Experience: The 1950's precursor to videotape, Kinescope, was employed recording this show, and that's unfortunate because there are profound soundtrack and image quality issues throughout. It's another reminder how wise Lucy and Desi were to actually film I Love Lucy.. don't expect the quality seen on reruns of that show here. In fact, the sound was completely out of synch throughout every show in the set. To even watch it I had to avoid looking directly at the players' faces as they spoke.Cox's Peepers is a sweet, gentle, amusing character -likeable from the start. When there's physical comedy the show is best, but the unfamiliarity of television makes for some awkward moments for otherwise seasoned actors. I am glad I got a taste of what the show had to offer but the quality is so poor I cannot recommend it, nor will I buy season 2. PS: One particularly bright spot is the addition of cast member Tony Randall whose polish and class way outdistance his costars.
__label__2 Babble Ball: My dog thinks this is the best thing in the entire world...depends on the dog...my friend's dog was not amused. My dog, however, plays with it nearly non-stop and I have had to buy batteries at least twice now d/t his activity. I also bought a spare Babble Ball! I highly recommend it for the energetic, curious, easily bored dog!! I find the sound hilarious, not annoying, so if you are easily put off by your dog having lots of fun in a rather noisy environment, then this is not at all the toy for your pup. I find it a joy to watch!
__label__2 great service, excellent value: I am very impressed with the value, the delivery time, and in general, everything about my purchase.
__label__1 disjointed: While Walker successfully conveys the tension and fatigue of the rescuers and the terror of the rescuees, he is not a friend of language. His technical descriptions, biographical paragraphs and unrelated chapters make this a difficult story to follow. The editors should have shortened this book by about half by cutting information and tightening up the writing. It is a great story but a challenge to read
__label__1 Not all as was....: I am in this book...not all the facts are exactly like it was....and I agree with the person that said there was more information about the families than was necessary.
__label__2 Five-star music, 1 star sound quality: The importance and rarity of the recordings of Rollins and Cherry make this worth savoring. It's like watching the final game of the world series through a knot-hole in the fence, though.
__label__1 This is not good: Flaw has put out a cd that is slow and boring, I can't understand why anyone would like this. Through the Eyes is an hour of nothing but waiting for the songs to come alive. They never do.
__label__2 Inspirational music thats hard to find these days: FLAW - THROUGH THE EYES, an album that deserves another review. Chris Volz along with Ian Kenny from Karnivool is one of the most underrated vocalists of all time. Through the eyes is an emotional monster of an album, from the opening distorted riff of "Only the strong" to the soothing drum roll at the end of "One More Time" Flaw put together a great blend of hard rock/metal that is filled with Volz's inspiring lyrics, full of emotion begging the listener to here his cries of pain, willing people to find a positive outlook on life and everything it throws at you..
__label__2 Flaw rocks: What can I say. This album is amazing in every aspect. I can hardly seem to get it out of my CD player. Anyone who says they are just another clone has no clue.
__label__2 It's a shame it was so greatly ignored....: This book is the very moving libretto of the musical based on the Hilton twins. The only thing I dislike about the book is the fact you can not see or hear the actors or the songs! That is why I reccomend buying the cd as well! (Also found here on amazon)
__label__2 this is so good!: I am a LOTR geek, seen the movie in the thearters 8 times, including the time i went twice in one day, got the movie on DVD the day it came out, and watched 3 times since. it is11:19am thursday 8. ok; you get to be gimli, legolas, or aragorn. you battle orcs, you can interact with other carracters, and: secret bonus: on the special features disk, click more then go to the very bottom, it should have a little preview of this game. thanxs for listening!~bye~
__label__1 What the ... where they thinking?: I was hoping for a game that ADDS to the movie, instead I GOT the movie, full with behind the scenes footage! Argg, what a waste of money. It repeats the ENTIRE movie. There is so much time wasted on the movie clips and 1/1000th of that is actual game play. Why make a game at all? There could have been so much more to it, if they took the time.
__label__2 I LUV LOTR!: I am a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, ...(date today, 9/12. I luv legolas!) and the first time I saw it, I thought: this move would make a great game! well, from all the reviews, It's lived up to that. I for one will probably play as legolas, since he can fire arrows about two or three times a second, but with this game, you can't win by pushing the same buttons repeatedly. You need to do combos of hits and different combinations, or the enemy will catch on to what you're doing. ... The game developers said that themselves. Just don't turn your back on the screen, and you'll be fine. :D
__label__1 IGNORE THE HYPE!!!: This game was the worst let down. Listen, I know all of people seem to be praising it. But, I tell you, the controls are very very poor. The game design itself is horrible. Yes, the graphics look great, and yes those previews seem cool, but I promise you, it IS NOT WORTH IT. The combination attacks that you gain with levels can be more frustrating than useful. Secondly, the game provides NO guidance what so ever as to how to defeat many baords. Believe me, HORRIBLE GAME DESIGN. I played it for a while, then decided I would stick with it and beat the while thing, as I did. When doing so, you see a quick, and somewhat lame, part of the two towers movie. BIG DEAL once the movie comes out. I realize this sounds picky, but if you are a traditional gamer and a Lord of the Rings fanatic, as I am, this game will frustrate your gaming side. If all you want is story, buy the book. Or maybe just watch the Home Shopping Nework. It's far more entertaining.
__label__2 '' A COOL BUT HARD GAME '' !!: I REALLY ENJOYED THIS GAME A GREAT DEAL !THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT YOU NEED TO USE A LOT OF COMBO ATTACKS IN THE LATER LEVELS, WHERE YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES ..IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF YOU COLD SAVE HALFWAY THRU A LEVEL , SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE LEVEL AGAIN.ONLY TWO LEVELS WERE EXTREMELY HARD , AND COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT EASIER .MAINLY THE LEVELS WHERE YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE GATE TO THE FORT AT HELMS DEEP.AS WELL AS HELMS DEEP TOO.. BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS A COOL VERY ADDICTIVE GAME TO PLAY. AND THE GRAPHICS MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WATCHING THE MOVIE..AND THE LEVELS ARE ALL COOL TOO, AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO PLAY AS 3 DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TOO..SO PICK IT UP AND HAVE A GREAT TIME !!
__label__2 I LUV LOTR!: I am a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, Ive watched the movie 20 times (date today, 9/12. I luv legolas!) and the first time I saw it, I thought: this move would make a great game! well, from all the reviews, It's lived up to that. I for one will probably play as legolas, since he can fire arrows about two or three times a second, but with this game, you can't win by pushing the same buttons repeatedly. You need to do combos of hits and different combinations, or the enemy will catch on to what you're doing. Also, don't think that the troll in Balin's toom is the only one in the game. They can pop up anywhere. I mean ANYWHERE. The game developers said that themselves. Just don't turn your back on the screen, and you'll be fine. :D
__label__2 A really awsome Game!!!: My friend rented this game and we fell in love with it. It has alot of action. God modes. It is also not one of those games that could be better. If it was any better it would be impossible to beat. It is one of those games that even if you die. You are so adictied you can't stop. i wount tell any more about the game because it would give it all away. I recomnd it even if you hated the movie.
__label__2 Best Game Ever: This game is awsome because you get to play as the cool guys.You can play as Aragorn he is a ranger,a strong man skilled in the use of many weapons,including swords,and trained to survive in every situation.He is also Aratorn's son and hier to Isildur's throne,the rightful king of Gondor,Legolas he is a noble Eleven prince,deadly accurate with his Eleven bow and knowledgeable in wilderness lore,or as Gimli he is a stubborn dwarf altough he is short he is the strongest of all three,there's also a secret character which is Isildur.It also has awsom graphics it also has scenes from the movie,the soundtrack from The Fellowship,and intreviews with the stars.There are levels from The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers there are 12 levels in all plus the secret mission.I also like how they put the cutscene with the game and that suddenly some of the cutscenes turn to the game. Don't think about buying the game just buy it its worth it.
__label__2 hidden charachteer: I don't kmow how to unlock him but i know that you can unlock the playable charachter Isildour
__label__2 Lotsa Fun but It Isn't for the Casual Gameplayer: This game is for those who want to add strategy to their typical action game. Learning some of the combos can be a bit tough, but once you get em going, you are unstoppable. The best moves to use once you buy them are the Linked Moves (Goblin Bane, Orc Bane, Bane of Saruman). Once you have those, you're guranteed a great level. The later levels, especially Hornburg Courtyard, and near impossible without those and the Rising Attack. The extras in the game are great. Interviews with Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortenson, John-Rhys Davies, Sir Ian McKellan, and Peter Jackson are great. The tidbits from the film are wonderful too. Buy it if you're into strategy/action/roleplaying.
__label__1 Unsatisfying...: Ok, folks here it is, if you're thinking about buying this game, pick up Gauntlet Dark Legacy instead. This game is the perfect example of how video game companies will try to capitolize on anything they can get thier greedy littl hands on without putting any effort into trying to make a game that's even slightly interesting. The combat is monotonous, the levels are straight out of the first two movies, so if you've seen them, there's really nothing to motivate you to try and finish the game. The controls are unresponsive... do you need to know anything else?
__label__2 whats more entertaining than shooting fish in a barrel....: destroying urk-hai as they run out at you from a million places!this game is great, the graphics are so smooth and the game play is amazing. Mixing scenes from the movie with video game cinamatics adds a more real effect.it has a very nice charecter system leveling up is a bit differant that other games, as well as the powerup purchasing.there are three charecters that you can play the adventure as and compare how you did with each. Legalos, Aragon / strider, and gimli! there all three soo cool.i dont want to go away and give anything away like how to defeat anything that up to you :Pill end with saying THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME.untill next time kill quickly !!--LoTr's fan
__label__2 That-a-way George: OK...So George Strait can't write songs,Whoopee, He sure can pick good songsand sings them very well.And he keeps it Country !
__label__2 Old Reliable Goes One Better: This CD is addictive. George is in fine voice with a selection of tunes offering appealing melodies that seem simple at first, but display a rich complexity with further listening. He's so good with Merle Haggard songs, and "My Life's Been Grand" is a real treat. My favorite is "The Middle of Nowhere." Though the selections cover a variety of styles, this is not a disjointed bunch of songs. It's a delightful mix that will entertain many times. Pop this in your car's CD player, and you will have a more than worthy traveling companion.
__label__2 The King of country does it again!: Every time I buy a George Strait CD, I put it in the CD player, relax in my favorite chair & just get lost in that voice. This CD is no exception. It is a wonderful array of music that any country music lover would enjoy. ("Run" and "My Lifes Been Grand" are my favorites at this point.) Mr Strait gets better with every album. That smooth baritone is so relaxed & gets the point across that he's still having fun recording great country music after 20+ years. He is undoubtedly the reigning King Of Country Music....Amen!P.S. She'll Leave You With A Smile is NOT, I repeat NOT the same song he recorded a few years ago.Diane
__label__1 Hard to read: I could not get into this book at all, even with the fact that Ellen Douglas was a fellow Greenvillian.
__label__1 For mathematicians: This book is written for mathematicians. Every two or so paragraphs, the authors expect the reader to carry out some proof. In other words, the authors provide the guidelines, and expect you to do all the legwork.
__label__2 A Paradise of Reading...: I loved it. The very first Tami Hoag book I ever read and I damn loved it. She has a way of trapping people's attention with her words, her breathtaking descritptions and incredible characters. I couldn't stop reading it!
__label__1 dark paradise: I found this to be 1 of the worst novels written by this author and I doubt that I will buy any other novels by the same author.I couldn't concentrate on the characters or get into the flow of the story.
__label__2 I enjoyed book thoroughly!!!!!!: I have read all of Tami Hoags' other mysteries and enjoyed everyone of them. Some I found a bit too lengthy in description, but I really enjoyed this book because it was a nice relaxing 'easy' read. Perfect for an airplane ride. I think she has wonderful talent, and truly believable characters. I must confess, I hope I hear more about Marilee and J.D. in the future. Her description of Montana took you there, and she was right on target with the small town outlook on life.
__label__1 This is a romance novel with a little suspense: After reading several great Tami Hoag thrillers (Night Sins, Guilty as Sin, Ashes to Ashes, Thin Red Line) I was very disappointed with this book. This is no competitor to Stephen King novels. This is strictly romance. Tami Hoag is great at thrillers but should leave the romance to Nora Roberts.
__label__2 Professional package at Prosumer price: I am a professional and we've used these now for about 5 years (maybe more) -- it is an incredible value for the money. I've put these up against Wireless systems that cost +/- 4000 USD and the Sennheiser knocks the windsocks off the "professional" brands as far as I'm concerned. We have (more than once) concealed one of these on a race car driver, under his racesuit and picked up perfect audio as long as he was in range ... which I think is better than some of the competitors as well!
__label__1 No compatability for Macs or Linux: This camera seems pretty good from the specs, but buried in the description is that you can view the images with Internet Explorer only! It turns out that it uses an ActiveX control for showing the video. Do these people think it's still 1998? There are people at my work using Macs and Linux machines, and there is no way for them to access the video feed. Haven't these people ever looked at YouTube? It's possible to have open standards that work across different platforms, and not rely on antiquated technologies like ActiveX.
__label__1 Good but very short life span: I bought 3 of these and also bought about 14 of the 5300 model. These more expensive cameras with an optical zoom lens seemed to be good at first but they all eventually failed in the same way. The video has gone completely black on all three after about a year. The audio stil works and I suppose I could still use them as a 2-way comunication device, but that expensive color video with zoom is now useless. I tried running one again today just in case... but no luck. Same problem. Looking on the web I see that others have the same problem. This is the most expensive d-link product that I have bought and most disapointing. I was hoping that someone out there may know a way to fix them but I have not seen an answer on the web.
__label__1 Minimal: Very little content. If you want to learn about West Virginia, this is not the source.Waste of money.
__label__1 It might be a fun game...: It doesn't work. I tried it on several computers. I have to figure out how to return it right now. Unfortunately the envelope was tossed out. I'll figure out who I bought it from and update so you can avoid buying anything from them. It wasn't Amazon but somebody who sells through them. I think my copy was pirated. Well, like I said, I'll update.
__label__2 This game is good, but easy.: ProsAll of the weapons are creative and fun to use.It has a good story line.They have clever obticals to go through.The monsters are cool looking.They infobot videos are funny so you won't get too bored playing the game.ConsEverything is very easy to do.When clank commands the little robots you can't call them from very far away, so if one of them dies you have to go all the way back to the beginning to find them.It is hard to get bolts because there are no arena battles for money, you have to destroy boxes and kill enemies and that takes a while.Hover boarding is a little tedious,annoying and hard to win.Overall this game is very good, but sometime gets frustrating andI would say this game is about as good as the next Rachet and Clank game.
__label__1 trashy: this game isnt really that good. its fun but there lots to be desired. like first of all cant you people think of anything besides weapons. oh yeah weapons weapons they make a game dont they. please you closeminded fools cant see anything but weapons. but thats what this uncreative pile of garbage is all about unfortunately. intelligint gamers will now read on. basically youre in this space world and you just pretty much kill everything you see. this game is just a stupid uncreative trashy pile of crud designed for people too dumb to understand anything. here are the cons and pros of the game. cons annoying characthers linear gameplay pure uninteligince no creativity or classic platform elements. pros nice cartoony bright graphics excellent flow of well put together music. so bottom line is rent this if youre an intelligant person who want creativity in a game rather than walking with a gun preparing to shoot the life out of everything like a fool.
__label__2 Such a Fun Game: I got this game on the pretext of getting it for the kids, but really got it because I thought it looked fun. It's been a lot of fun helping the kids through the levels and finding those golden bolts hidden throughout the game. There are only a few things I didn't like about the game, or rather thought was frustrating. Changing weapons is a pain. You have to go to a separate menu to get to your items and weapons. Another thing is that the last few levels are so difficult it was even hard for me to get through and impossible for my kids. Other than those issues, the levels are fun and colorful. The little upgrades, new weapons, and new items make leveling up fun.
__label__1 WHAT HAPPENED!!!: being a big Olivia fan i feel terrible about this CD. listened to it once and that will be the last. Olivia's beautiful voice seems very out of place singing Christmas songs. She almost sounds at times as if she has lost her voice. Very dissapointing. Just glad i wasted my money on her (if thats a comfort to me)
__label__2 Still sweet: Overall I'm happy with this CD. Olivia's still sweet and lovely voice is well suited to traditional Christmas carols. However, her voice is simply too delicate to compete with the London Symphony Orchestra, and she simply shouldn't have attempted Ave Maria, which can really only be conquered by a classically trained operatic singer. (Oh Holy Night is a stretch for her, too.) Otherwise, the CD is fun in a sing-along sort of way, and I remain a loyal fan.
__label__1 Good voice, but not the Huey I want to hear!: I really like the Huey from the DLG albums. I know one must move on eventually. But, maybe I'm , just so used to the DLG Huey that I can't get used to this other stuff on this CD. I'm still a huey Fan. Huey has taking salsa to another level in my life!!!!
__label__1 Cheap Plastic XXap: The clear plastic part that attaches to the camera broke on mine (as it did on other reviewers) the first time I used it. If your camera costs more than this toy, don't attach it and expect it to survive being dropped. If the manufacturer wanted to make a quality product they would have fixed this design long ago. They just want to get rich on impulse buys.Amazon now has a similar device made of *real metal* at the same price. If you want one, I'd suggest buying that device; it can be no worse than this.
__label__1 battery won't hold charge: The battery didn't hold a charge more than an hour or two - in standby mode.
__label__1 Beware Cheap Plastic - Not as Pictured: These are cheap plastic chips not worth the postage. I am immediately returning for credit!
__label__2 Self Wipe Toilet Aid: This is a good tool for caregivers to assist their patients. The Wipe Toilet Aid makes life easier for handicape people and their caregiver.We have used this product for at least several years.
__label__1 Boring and dull: I have to agree with the majority. This book was not worth reading.There was nothing to like about anyone and the story was boring.
__label__1 Great Writing, HORRIBLE PREMISE...: I love Rachel Gibson as a writer. She has a wonderful way with words, and it is that alone which allows me to give this book 2 stars. Because I absolutely hate the story line. I just cannot enjoy a romance novel in which the heroine has kept a child away from his/her father. It is absolutely unforgiveable. If the father is a maniac or unfit, and it is done to protect the child physically, then sure. But to never tell the hero that he has a child solely because "I was afraid you didn't love me any more", is ridiculous. And that was Daisy's excuse. After that, I just didn't want to see Jack fall back into a relationship with Daisy. It was a lousy thing that she did, and she is the worst kind of heroine--selfish and inconsiderate. I'll try other Gibson books, but this one is a must skip for anyone who feels the way I do on the subject. If you like lying, deceitful, selfish heroines then this is the one for you. Because like I said in the beginning, it is well written.
__label__1 So disappointed: Daisy is a bitch and I didn't want her to have a happy ending. What she did was unforgivable and I'm so mad Jack forgave her.Besides that the book was well written.
__label__1 Not funny--that says it all: When I hear there's a new Rachel Gibson novel coming out, I pre-order. I've been waiting for Daisy's Back in Town for months.What a disappointment. If this had been written by another author, one who is known for angst not humor, I might have given it more stars. But, Rachel, if you're going to take our money, we deserve a good story in return.In the second half, there were about 10-20 lines that reminded me of this terrific author's voice, but it wasn't enough to save the book.And, to the reviewer who suggested all the negative reviews are written by one person, get over it. If you liked the book, fine. But many of us obviously didn't.Go back to Ms. Gibson's earlier titles. They are wonderful. I'm going to toss this one and try the funny ones again.
__label__1 Once was enough...: The book was a decent Tom Peters style book to get you pumped up about your ideas. However, why re-release a book with a different name? Also, what happened to the other two books that were supposed to be added to the Jump Start theme? I would rank this book along side the Crystal Pepsi idea he had.
__label__2 TIMELESS TREASURE: This book is timeless. I have read this book so many times. Each time I understand the spiritual world and God even more. I love the fact that unlike some religions she does not expect us to speak in tongues or criptic languages to our LORD.If you are searching to enhance your spiritual side and bring God into your life every day...this is it. I have done what she prescribes and my life was transformed. I highly recommend these books.Buy today.
__label__1 I love a mystery, but not this one: Scottish author John Ward writes in a style common to occultist books. The language in THE SECRET OF THE ALCHEMIST is continental, some terms would doubtless be unfamiliar to most readers. There also is some vulgarity. I found hints of sexuality and depravity. In one scene, a woman is drugged, then her young daughter is stolen from her. She is doused with alcohol so that the police will think her a drunkard, and her story of her child's abduction to be merely the ranting of a street person.Though a book source I found said the book was for readers 9-12, I would not give this novel to anyone under the age of fourteen or fifteen. Even if they could wade through the obscure language and literary references, the overall dark tone of the book is not for younger readers. NOT RECOMMENDED. Caution for some language and adult content.
__label__1 DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER !!: DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER !!The ink cartridges hold only 5 ml of ink and cost around $15. That means that it's gonna cost you $15 for only 135 pages !! If you print out a book with 260 pages its gonna cost you $30 !! You'll go broke using this printer.The low price is just a hook, do not be fooled as I was. HP is a bad company with no respect for its costumers.
__label__2 VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRINTER SO FAR...: I recently bought this printer for basic printing needs. I am very pleased with it so far. I don't find it to be too noisy, it prints good quality. I dont recommend it for pictures/photos but for your basic printing needs its a good buy. I don't find the ink to be too expensive. It is by far much cheaper than the lexmark ink I used to have to by for my lexmark printer(junk). But if you want an inexpensive printer for your basic printing needs I would recommend this one, and for less than $50, well you really can't go wrong. Don't let the bad reviews steer you away from this printer. Its a good basic printer.
__label__2 Quality, plain & simple: I have used a variety of priming tools. Some give a better sense of touch, but none approach the durability and overall quality of this one. Took some getting used to but now I wouldn't consider going back to the hand squeeze type.
__label__1 Crash and burn: It takes pretty good pictures but it's slower than Jake's dog. Press the shutter release after a lengthy auto focus and wait awhile for it to 'click'. Then wait some more while it saves the picture (it shows a message asking you if you want to delete it, a play to make you believe it's waiting on YOU.) The only plus I can think of right now is the 8X optical zoom.Now it doesn't want to do anything, pretty much. In the docking port it shows that it's on aux power and won't recharge the batteries. The lens comes out but a get a multitude of different actions: red light flashing, lcd screen won't come on, no battery charge indicator because the first screen won't stay on long enough, etc., etc. Even the diagnostic test (hold the flash button and turn on the camera) doesn't work anymore. I guess it's just a boat anchor now unless someone has a better suggestion.I think I'll just go top notch and buy a GOOD camera, like a Nikon D2x!!
__label__2 HP Photosmart 945: Great camera. Not for those people looking to slip a slim camera in there shirt pocket. Has some bulk, but that gives it the look of a traditional 35mm camera. Zoom works great and is easy to operate. Lots of neat functions that are easy to figure out. Lens cap strap was a great idea (I dropped the cap every time I took it off, before I put on the strap). LCD is easy to see. Downloading pics is simple, just attach the cable to your computer and it downloads automatically. Recommend the base unit too. Easy to use and recharges batteries. Overall, very pleased with this camera.
__label__1 Great features, but problem with some images: While having great features, the camera seems to suffer a serious flaw: Some pics have Horizontal lines which ruin the pics. I've seen other reports of the same flaw, some indicating and exchange from HP support might help. Yet, HP support does not acknowledge any problem (offered an exchange, but would not say if that fixes anything or acknowledge others reported the same problem). Watch for this and be aware before purchasing this camera. I'd wait for the next version or go with another brand.
__label__1 Disappointing: I think the intent of this book is great. The wedding planning process, as well as transitioning into married life, is incredibly stressful and no one really talks about it. However, I found I could not relate to the whole psychoanalytical approach used in the book. I kept thinking, "Well, maybe the next section will be helpful." But it never was! Perhaps because of my age (39), I've already done more introspection than most brides and did not need validation that I'm not "crazy," because of all the insanity surrounding the process. Some of the quotes from other brides were interesting, but the book was just too "out there" to be useful, at least for me.
__label__2 Early Sinatra: Early Sinatra at his best. The phrasing and carryover into the lyrics is simply, SINATRA!
__label__1 Will not fit: Does not fit over bird cage . The hole is to small, other than that its a fairly nice peice
__label__2 Eschatology Made Simple: This little book (I read it in 1 sitting), describes The Revelation in simple terms. It takes a difficult book of the Bible and instead of making it more complicated does the reverse. Revelation means revealed, not shrouded, as are most books that are written about the Revelation. They have meanings that are concealed in images which are demanded by a literal interpretation of the text. If you are a church member that believes that Christians are losing the battle, this book is for you. We are not losing we are winning . . . today, not sometime in the future after the temple gets rebuilt. If you are looking at the NY Times in order to interpret the Bible then STOP and buy this book, for that matter, buy enough for your entire church!!!
__label__2 Daughter loved it!!: My 7 year old loved it....and that's all that mattered to me. Now of course, she wants Heat Miser. Next year.
__label__2 underrated: I would give her debut album a 3 1/2 star, it's a good effort but it lacks substance. This song, however, is one that i can't get bored of. Trashed is catchy with great lyrics and Skin delivers it with conviction that one can relate to.
__label__2 Wake up the shower...and you...with Axe: Axe's product line of Shower Gels are marked "Revitalizing" for a reason - the striking scent and the awesome clean, while using them, get a person ready to face even a dreary morning. The handy gripper-sides help you hang on in the slipperiest of conditions. Whoever enters the bathroom after Axe has been there first, is treated to an second-hand wake-up with the residual aroma.
__label__2 In Maremma one finds the warm, Italian personalities: I didn't expect David Leavitt to be humorous, but In Maremma is often quite funny and offers an observation that is priceless. Life in the Italian marshlands, the region where the author and his partner make their new home, is the off-the-beaten track in mainland Italy as one gets, where the people are authentic and down-to-earth. Each chapter engages the reader with succinct and often humorous account of the mundane, "day-to-day" life made interesting, such as going to the olive press or refurbishing a home. Despite the book's brevity, it is replete with historical tidbits and descriptions of luscious Italian foods as well as characters. The tone and voice of this book makes it a pleasure to read and you'll want to go to the Maremma as well. Buy it or borrow it from your local public library!
__label__1 Seems Written Just to Pay for their House: Of all the travel memoirs I've read, I'm sorry to say that this one is the least engaging. I've been an admirer of David Leavitt's writing for a very long time, but reading this I couldn't help but feel (again and again) that it was just thrown together haphazardly as a means of paying for the couple's house. Well, why not? Except it just doesn't interest much. It's a shame. A great missed opportunity. For a better read read Annie Hawes' Extra Virgin and its sequel Ripe for the Picking, and At Home in France by Ann Barry.
__label__1 It really is beyond....: My son and I have read the Spiderwick Chronicles, own the movie and have listened to the audio books. I bought this to carry on and wow, I had to remind him of words we don't use that they said on the audio. These words: Lard a**, idiot and loser all directed at step siblings. I didn't enjoy the narrator either, his tone just sounded bitter. The other reviews were right on. Just a fair warning.
__label__1 Irresponsible: Let me preface this by saying we haven't even read the book. We never even got that far. Why? Because after we got home and before my 7 year old son began reading, I just perused the book and realized the inappropriate language (referenced in other negative reviews here so I don't need to explain.) The back copy of my edition recommends the book for ages 7 and up. These are words my 7 year old has never even heard--nor has my 9 year old. I had heard good things about this series but we're done. Absolutely irresponsible and gratuitous. I'm appalled.
__label__1 Not as good as original series; Bad language unnecessary: We enjoyed the original series immensely. We were very disappointed, however, with this book. The characters were not particularly engaging. The bad language was unnecessary. We were disappointed with the changes in Jared's character (quite snotty, now). It almost seems that the book was written in a hurry while the authors were somewhat depressed.
__label__2 If its wood I love it: I love building furniture. I have several pieces in my home now. as I am building to replace a store bought piece.
__label__1 NOT THE REAL PRODUCT: THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THEY ARE ADVERTISING!! The product that they sent was a different style. I called them, they said they couldnt accept a return (which is understandable) but that the real product was out of stock. They then said that they would order the product and ship it to us. It was at least 2 weeks and I still hadnt received anything so I called and they said that they had "discontinued" the product and that they wouldnt be able to give me a refund. It wasnt until I brought up false advertising and possibly contacting someone else about getting a refund (amazon) that they put me on hold and got a manager. THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE ADVERTISING they are horrible at customer service this company sucks.
__label__1 not what I expected: Not all the songs in the movie are on the cd. My wife was disappointed that the club scene song was not on this cd. Would not have bought this product if I knew that.
__label__1 Threw It Away After the First Play: I don't know what movie they got this music from, but it's nothing that I remember from Shallow Hal. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 great product: This is a great product. It is great for plane rides and long trips and anytime you need to watch a video ipod for long stretches of time. It has saved me on numerous occasions. I now have two, one for each kid.
__label__1 Worked on my previous IPod: I purchased this for my 2006 iPod Video and it worked great - held up on 10 hour flights, etc. Then my iPod Video died and I got what I thought was the same exact iPod (August 2007, Software Version 1.2.1) and when I tried to attach the Maxell Battery Pack, my iPod tells me that it's not compatible!I'm mad at Apple for doing this, but I'd love to know what Battery Pack will work, now that I have a useless Maxell one.
__label__2 A Wonderful CD!: Addictive! An album that is truly worth buying - FANTASTIC collection of songs. Charles Webster is so so so fabulous.
__label__1 Very misleading: Not sure who this book was intended for. It is basically a dictionary of sorts, trying to define all sorts of food types and methods. Two problems come up quickly. First the definitions are very terse and of little use. Explaining stock as bones and vegetables cooked together, does little to help the reader gain understanding, and that is one of the better definitions! Secondly, many of the terms are outdated or missing. I realize how long ago Escoffier lived, but the references to items that changed their names a hundred years ago, makes finding anything very difficult, and usually completely unrewarding.
__label__1 I gave up: I started this book, put it down, then started it again. Finally, I put it down and won't be picking it up again. It failed to grab my attention from the get-go. It seems like it took forever for anything to happen. And, it was incredibly boring. I am disappointed with the plethora of paranormals around lately. I am afraid that authors have to write this genre of book and either aren't wild about doing it, or they jump in too quickly and don't fully develop their story.Sherrilyn Kenyon has such a fully developed Dark Hunter, etc. world that her books really pull you in. Karen Marie Moning and her fairy stories are built upon of layer after layer of well researched and written material. This book just didn't get my attention, so I decided to move on in hopes of coming across something worth reading.
__label__1 What was I thinking?: If you like sappy rediculous romance novels - you may like this. I should have known better just by looking at the cover. I stopped reading it after the first chapter. My book club gave this book a good rating but they just want to sell more books.
__label__2 Beatles songbook was awesome: Beatle fans will love this as it tells a story about songs and also has words..as if we dont know them already!I was at Shea Stadium, 1965!!!
__label__2 Great for gymnasts: My 12 year old gymnast daughter was having heal pain, so we ordered two of these. One of them tore at the seams after the first few uses, but Amazon replaced it immediately and so far the 2 we have are wearing just fine. They work well for her as a gymnast who trains 12-13 hours a week.
__label__1 This item only for sports use: I purchased this product for easing pain caused by my heel spur. The product shifts constantly and is not made to wear with shoes which is what I purchased it for. The cup of the heel is very thin and does not require the support i needed.
__label__2 Really Helps: My feet hurt so bad. The moment I put these on there was relief. They need to make one left and one right. That would make it easier to put on if you need two at a time like I do. But otherwise, worth it.
__label__1 Shop around: I was tempted to buy from this company due to the lower cost than other companies were selling it for. After seeing that the item was IN STOCK, I purchased 2 heel cups. I was given a week for my shipment. The day my order was suppose to arrive, Allegro medical sent me an e-mail stating my order was on Backorder and the product should be shipped in 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks passed, I called the company and they informed me that it was STILL on backorder. I would of not known that unless I contacted them. Therefore I ended up canceling my order. The company's customer service guy was very nice and apologetic, but it doesn't help the fact that it is now over a month since I placed the order and I have no product, plus the company is still posting that the product is IN STOCK. Shop somewhere else, it is worth the extra money!
__label__1 This stuff killed my stomach: I ran out of my TwinLabs Creatine Mono about a week ago, and decided to try this version, which has more supplements added to it, instead of reordering the 'plain' creatine. I've taken Creatine several times, and never experienced the bloat that other have complained about - until now. The bloat I've had for the last 5 days on this stuff is awful, and no matter how much water I drink, juice I take it with, or food I eat with it, the gas is unbearable. My flat stomach is temporarily gone and I have been spending way too much time in the bathroom. I have not been able to get a good ab work out in because of the discomfort (I usually work them really hard, but have not been able to push it as far on this stuff). I am taking the reccomended dosage, so it's not a matter of taking too much of it. I realize that this may not happen to everyone, but this stuff does not work well for me. I'll be switching to a different brand.
__label__1 not the book I thought it would be: From the first few pages of this book I realized it was not for me. (I did stop reading after the first chapter.) The graphic descriptions of horrible and sad personal stories of children were just too hard to read. These are Christian writers, so I wrongly assumed they would not need to include such graphic details that I can find all over the secular media. I also feel some of the advice about when to have these conversations was premature. I understand we live in a broken world, and am not insulated from it, but I feel this book goes too far.
__label__2 Very RELAXING... Zen: I really enjoy using this video. I like the guy that leads the video. He is very calming. Good workout.. Love the music by Sting.. All around a good end to a long day!
__label__2 Fun, cute, and practical.: Wherever I go I receive several compliments on my Yoda Back Buddy. Who could question these random appreciative city people? He's amazing! When I saw him, I liked him better than Chewbacca and R2D2 combined; I had to have him. The way he clings to your back is just adorable. Superb attention to detail! It really looks like Yoda is holding onto my back (or, evidently, to some a really homely child)! It inspires fellow Star Wars fans around you to talk about their favorite parts of the movies and stuff with you. It's pretty cool.He's also pretty durable. I've been carrying him for awhile with all of my essential belongings and placing him on the ground whenever I sit down, and he still looks great and not a seam split!Uh, very educational... extraterrestrial biology?... lol.I certainly recommend this product.
__label__2 Vergil and his adventures: In the middle ages a legend sprouted that Vergil (yes, the ld roman) was a great magician. Davidson wrote this novel within this old fantasy setting. Minotaurs and witches abound, but so does a frightfully accurate knowlege of the ancient world. Quite a good read for those who like their historical fiction to be both well grounded and full of fanciful flights.
__label__1 not that interesting: I had to read this for anthro class; not that great. To me, it was borderline of fake and real, even though the guy actually went through it all
__label__1 PLEASE don't waste your money!!: There is no exercise shown on this DVD that should be done on a small trampoline. You'd be better off using a yoga mat. Why would you lie down on a trampoline meant for jumping and try to exercise?
__label__1 Uncertain: I can't remember if I reviewed this product already....Ok. That was a joke, as this product is supposed to enhance your memory.This product hasn't shown any drastic increases in memory as of yet, and I have been taking the recommended dosage daily.It's been nearly 3 1/2 weeks with no results.Maybe in the next few weeks I'll see some noticeable difference.If so maybe this review will be edited.If not it will stand.I assume I've waited long enough for the supplements to enter my system, and begin to do their job, but I could be wrong.Be warned.Bucky Wilson(...)
__label__1 No noticable results: Took the whole bottle (not at once LOL) and couldn't tell any difference. I won't re-order and will continue looking for something better.Several years ago I took some kind of Andrew Lessman memory pills. They worked, but were expensive, the dosage was 5 or 6 pills, and they smelled and tasted bad. I may end up going back to them.
__label__2 perfect fit: These mirrors are a perfect fit for your 86-93 Mazda B series pickup. It is a replica in the same style as the OEM chrome upgrade mirrors. Quality is slightly less than OEM. I gave it 4 stars. The fit and style are perfect. The chrome is plastic, not metal. It looks good, but it is not very thick. For the price, I was very impressed by the product and the improvement it made to the looks of my vehicle. It functions and fits perfectly. This mirror only falls short of 5 stars in that it is a little light and thin on the plastic housing. I feel this product will function properly, look good, and last a long time, especially for the small amount of money it cost me. It is worth buying.
__label__2 Best Music ever: im not a die hard Metal guy, I listen to strictly Hardcore and some metalcore. But when one of my friends gave me a listen to this cd i was blown away. There is nothing wrong w/ this album, just like there is nothing wrong w/ any of their albums. They create perfect music w/ perfect vocals/chants, and the lyrics are awesome too (actually they made me go out a read a bunch of Tolkien stuff). If your looking for incredible music, buy this album
__label__2 Majestic, Imperial, Absolutely Amazing: This has to be Blind Guardian's best. This CD is full of fantastic guitars, drums, bass, and orchestral type infulences. If you've never listened to Blind Guardian before, this CD is a good place to start. This is honestly, the most prized CD I own, and my favoutite CD of any I've ever heard. I'd give it 20 stars, but even Amazon has it's limits =)
__label__2 Blind Guardian: Songs from Middle Earth: Nightfall In Middle Earth is one of the best CD's from Blind Guardian, having based it's liyrics in the book "The Silmarillion" written by J.R.R. Tolkien. For heavy metal lovers and fans of the work or J.R.R. Tolkien, this CD is an unvaluable item to buy
__label__2 Bow your heads to the gods of thunderous rock: Your bowels tremble as you gently place this recording into your player. You are in for a magical journey into Middle Earth. Your guides: the demi-mortals known only as BLIND GUARDIAN!!!!Your collection of pewter dragons shake as Gorlashes excelent bass skills pound your mothers lap dog into submission. Note to self: next time wrap those dragons in bubble wrap. The other-worldy drumming of VulcHammer tells the neighbors downstairs that you ARE the fantasy-metal giant in your building. NONE OTHER CAN MATCH THE SUPREMENESS OF BLIND GUARDIAN!!!!!!!!!Young Hobbits, very small, saw them hiding in the wall....DOW DOWOWOWOW...BOWOWOW....BAM BAM BAMYou cry as those last words hit your ears. Blind Guardian has cemented the literary works of Tolkein into the Pantheon of the Biblical Canon. GER GER PAM DDERRR, Take the ring from young gorlashes hand and bring it to VulcHammer!!!!BOW BEFORE BLIND GUARDIAN!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I love Bob Marley but: I love Bob Marley however this book wasn't what I expected, will return item. I didn't know the book was so small
__label__1 Boring!: I think the PC version of this game was much better. The PS2 version is a little slow and a kinda boring.
__label__1 Horried Sims Game Ever!!!!!!: Making out IS NOT WHAT I LIKE IN A SIMS GAME!!!!!!!!!! People should respect others that they should live alone. No ruler!!!! People should rate this better. It should be rated M= muture Very muture!!! Bewear People under 13!!!!!
__label__2 great window cleaner set: I have a lot of windows in my home and didn't know how to clean them. Many are out of reach without a long pole. I had to purchase a long pole to go with this set. This set really does the trick especially the squeegie which is a very good quality item. The bucket makes a big difference too in making the job easier. The window cleaner will last for years.
__label__2 Very cool album.: If you don't believe me, just put on Deep Red Bells. It's the coolest, most terrifying song I have possibly ever heard. DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP RED BELLS!!!
__label__1 Good for DJ work perhaps, not for home/office use!: I bought these headphones because I'm an old-fashioned audio listener (headphones MUST BE really Headphones: cord tangling, extra weight on your head and heating ears included).I use to listen music while I'm on bed, either before falling asleep or very early on Saturday mornings. For this purpose, these headphones have been tough on falling from bed to bare floor (no rug under my bed); however when connected to a low impedance headphone input (I have a mini 3CD component aside my bed), they produce a very noticeable and annoying low-frequency noise. It is clearly heard in the usual 2-3 seconds gap between songs on CDs.
__label__2 I have a demo for it for the PC...: And the lightning effects aren't at as a high resolution, and aren't as realistic but are still very good. All other engine quality is equal. The game ran much slower than it did on XBOX, 10fps. 30 on XBOX. Well wat dya expect when your running it on a GeForce 2 series video card. The game requires 256 mb of ram, 800MHZ pentium 3 or equivelant, 32mb 3-D hardware T & L directx8.1 compatible video card dx8.1 etc a bit higher than unreal 2's system requirements. This game still looks beatiful on the PC, a geforce 3 is recommended, I suggest a powerful computer for this game. :)
__label__1 Disappointment: Disappointing. Glossy pictures of unoriginal designs. Many selected plants would not survive in limited interior lighting.
__label__2 Worth Coming Home For: From the title song, I'm Coming Home, to the very last track on the album, this is a collection of songs by Thom Bell and Linda Creed that is sung beautifully (as usual) by Johnny Mathis. I'd Rather Be Here With You is the prettiest song on the album to me. Mr. Mathis sings each song with passion as he does with everything he sings. Although the Stylistics had a "hit" with I'm Stone In Love With You, Johnny sings it his way and puts his own stamp on it. I'm Coming Home is melancholy, beautiful, with a fresh sound to the Mathis legacy. This album is worth coming home to hear over and over again.
__label__2 Excellent quality!: Bought this watch for my girlfriend as a birthday gift and she absolutely loved it. The cordura band is the most comfortable she's ever worn and the watch itself is nicely colored and visible. the numbers and hands light up after being charged in the sunlight for a while and it even has a date window. The watch uses a screwdown technology that seals it from water damage and is used to adjust the time and date.
__label__2 Great Old Music: Great stuff from Buddy Rich! Older music but it never gets old! Great gift for jazz music lovers! Great addition to our collection!
__label__2 This is scary!: Adam and his friends found out that there was a doorway to the past that opened. Now there are powerful creatures in Spooksville. One rhinocerous even injuried Adam. Quick, They have to talk to Ann Templeton to get rid of these creatures.
__label__1 Stand barely fits: I would not recommend this mobile base. The planer stand barely fits, the legs are 1/2" off of the base. Also there is no way provided to attach the stand to the base. It would seem to me that this base is made for a different application, or the engineer that designed it never attempted to put the stand in the base. At a price of nearly $100.00 I expected a much better fit. Personally I would recommend puchasing a universal base at around $50.00 and making it fit. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because it is well constructed.
__label__2 Mertens at his best!: Anyone who likes contemporary minimal music (like P. Glass, M. Nyman, etc.) should love Wim Mertens. I find his music more dynamic and more emotional. "Integer Valor" is one of the best of his ensemble works-- very accessible and listenable. Try it!
__label__2 Healing After Loss: Daily Meditations for Working Through Grief: This is my first review I've left because I feel a need to sing the praises of this book & how it has helped me. It's been three years since my only child, my son died at age 26 from a drug related death. I've tried to read other books on grief and dealing with death of loved ones but found it hard to deal with their content. These meditations give me what I need in small daily doses and provides the healing I need.
__label__2 A useful tool for grieving: This book was given to me as a gift almost 10 years ago when my husband died. When I finally felt ready to open it I found it a very comforting way to end each day. The meditations come from a variety of sources, some faith-based, but not all. They seemed to reasonate with me regardless. Martha Hickman has a very genuine voice, down to earth, thoughtful and sincere. I have since given it to friends and family members when they have lost loved ones.
__label__2 Healing After Loss: Daily Meditations for Working Through Grief: This is one of the most informative books I have read so far, in my striving to cope with my grief. I lost my husband last April, and it had taken me until December before I was able to purchase books that would help me heal from his loss. I read this book religiously every morning, before I get started with my long, lonely day. Some nights, before I try to sleep, I read that day's entry once again. It helps me relax enough to get some well-needed sleep. This book boosts my morale, gives me hope, tells me that I'm not alone in my grief. Martha Whitmore Hickman seems to have researched the subject of this book very thoroughly. I hope to find more of her books.
__label__1 Don't Bother: A book written in 3 weeks (the author readily admits this in the Acknowledgments Section) attempts to explain a proof that was seven years in the making and to provide historical perspective on the mathematics underlying this proof -- don't waste your time or your money.
__label__1 Just wrong: The book is just wrong. Read the proof for yourself, Annals of Mathematics 141, 3 (1995) and decide for yourself.
__label__1 Promising title, no deliverance.: I am on page 19 and I simply had to quit. Ms. Stapinski was lucky to know some interesting characters, however, all these interesting people leave you emotionless and empty. The idiosyncrasies of her relatives are fed to the reader peace meal, and there is no coherence to her story. A far cry from the likes of Frank McCourt. Shame on you Newark Sunday Star-Ledger to compare the two as equal.
__label__1 First time I returned a product: This product received great reviews, including from professional stylists. I purchased it yesterday, tried it this morning, and returned it this afternoon. It has such a strong, old-lady smell that I would have washed my hair again immediately if I had the time. It's been eight hours and I can still smell it.
__label__1 Holds bikes OK but beware of your car model and bike size!: This rack does not seem to fit on the Nissan Xterra. The bike arm and upper support bar are one piece so when we tried to position the top bar above the rear windshield wiper the bike arm slanted down towards the ground. The rear windshield wiper on the Xterra does not allow you to position the bottom arm on the bumper with clearance for the wiper at the top. Maybe the rack isn't supposed to rest on the bumper?? Despite our bikes hanging at an angle towards the ground they did seem to stay in place pretty well after hassling with all of those squirrely rubber straps. My husband's bike has a smaller frame though which was a real headache to try and force onto the rack. Sadly we will have to return this rack.
__label__1 Buy it for the labels, not the software: The software is absolutely worthless. It has such limited formatting control that you will be unable to flow text inside the label, or outside the center hole, forcing you to position every line manually.Because the software is written in Java it cannot import any of the common formatted styles (such as MS Word), further limiting your options.I ended up uninstalling it and using Visio.
__label__1 Not even close to the right smell: The cannabis incense isn't close to smelling like burning marijuana. I have burned it before others came into the house (I know they have smoked marijuana before) and they asked what is that nasty smell! I can't use it for a class that I instruct teaching others about drugs, I'm glad I only bought one to try it.
__label__1 Uninspiring: The author actually recommends a birthday party at McDonald's. Then she assumes we all have silk flowers at home to decorate for a party. The book is outdated and boring. There are absolutely no pictures in the book. I would only recommend this book if you have no experience in party planning and are looking for a drab, run of the mill party that looks as though you stopped at the store Party City to decorate!
__label__1 Geometry textbook never received: I ordered the book. The seller was paid and I never received it. The seller sent me a report showing the tracking of the transaction, but I still do not get it.Will I lose the money?
__label__1 o my gosh: THIS ISNT EVEN FUNNY! i swear... every other problem is answered in the back of the book, (the odd ones) and its like i have to search back there every time... most of the time i cant even finish the problem. this book is so confusing, i would pay $500 for a new one... this SUCKS
__label__1 Big disappointment: My fifteen year old is using this book in LAUSD high school so I was confident that a book by an old Exeter professor would be more than adequate. I was wrong. Had Brown walked into an Exeter classroom with this book thirty-five years ago we would have nailed him spread eagle to a Harkness table. I bought my kid a copy of Weeks and Atkins, the book used by my prep school teacher Arthur Weeks and Brown himself when he taught at Exeter.
__label__2 Great Job!: This book came to us in a very timely manner. The price was great and it was in "as advertised" shape. thank you.
__label__2 Opened my eyes.: Know Bull opened my eyes to all the little things that happen in my day to day life that are actually BS. I guess part of me always knew it was BS, this book just help me identify it. Now that I've identified the BS, I've been successful at cutting it out of my life. It's been espically helpful in dealing with my business relationships.
__label__2 Came in time for Christmas: I ordered this for my son before christmas this came quick and works great!! Thanks u so much for everything. I would recommend u to anyone..
__label__1 Do NOT buy this game YET: Im a veteran Computer Baseball game player.If you plan on playing MVP 2004 Online, DONT BUY IT, yet!BUGS BUGS BUGS!This game is know for having a critical bug that RESTARTS the game against an Online buddy if either STEAL OR TRY TO STEAL a base. As soon as you do the game restarts in Inning 1. UNNACCEPTABLE. Its even happened on occasions where no stealing was done.I also had to spend $30 on a new PAD which I SHOULDNT have because that is such a disrespectful thing for EA to do in not supporting most Gamepads out there and forciong us to spend to get to play.ALL in all this GAME GAS POTENTIAL but not until the many bugs are patched. Lets put it this way, if this was an Airplane it would crash on its first flight.
__label__2 Great video... 2 year old loves it!: This is by far the best sesame street video we ever owned or have seen on TV. My 2 year old loves it!! The songs are catchy and very entertaining... even for adults!! You cannot go wrong with this purchase!
__label__2 The Three Questions: This book is beautifully illustrated, and sensitively written. "Being in the present moment" is what it's all about, and the book appeared just when I need to be reminded! I love this book.
__label__2 Deep: Great lesson! I got this book from the library, my husband and I read it to our 2 year old. We loved it, and are purchasing. We know it will be years before our daughter can comprehend the message in this book, it's still very cute for a 2 year old, our daughter loves the animals. If you are reading this to your little one who may only care about the pictures, it's a great read for the parents too. We could all use a little reminder every now and again about who's important.
__label__1 Stupid movie: The directors must think we are all stupid. But in reality, they are. This movie makes sure to put inappropriate family dialogue (sexual) in the first 10 minutes, spoiling it for parents of children. We turned it off after we had had enough. I watched it later alone to see if we should let the kids watch it. It did get better with less sexual innuendos but the characters were Americans???? acting as Brits???? The whole thing was just stupid! So many of the characters acted like idiots.The only redeeming message was that like Dorothy, she had the power all along to change her face. She just needed to like herself the way she was.Don't waste your money on this.
__label__2 Wonderful film!: This film is so enjoyable to watch. The story is of a girl who is born in a wealthy, famous family who has a curse on them that the first baby girl born will be born with a pig's nose. Christina Ricci plays Penelope, and her performance is flawless. Her character is someone you just root for the entire film, and it is so amazing that her will is so strong and her reactions to her deformity is so different than those of the people around her. I won't say more because I don't want to give too much away! But, I was not sure how I would like this movie, but I loved it. Its insipiring, and not only a fun film to watch, its also so beautiful. The art directing and the camera work are so gorgeous, and the movie has this fantasy/ fairy tale quality, while at the same time feeling modern and present-day. I would highly recommend this movie for its acting from Ricci, and Reece Witherspoon, and James McAvoy, the characters, moral, and sheer entertainment.
__label__2 Great music from a great band...: I have always been a supporter of local music, and the Buzzhorn has all the great qualities of a local band. They are down-to-earth, fun loving guys, who relate with any fan. They are also very talented musicians. They rock any venue they perform in, and can always get the crowd pumped up. Why you ask? Because its not about money, fame, success. Sure, it comes along with it, but to the Buzzhorn, it is all about the music, and that is why the Buzzhorn is so enjoyable. Any fan of Led Zeppelin or Alice in Chains will like the Buzzhorn. If nothing, at least see them perform live. It's an experience you will not forget.
__label__1 Not what I was expecting: It does what it's supposed to do, but it's very flimsy, and most of the compartments are not as roomy as I was expecting. Definitely not worth 20 bucks.
__label__1 bad choice: I'm trying to organize my space and this item was a very big disappointment. It fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging. The organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package. The retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer. The areas for bows allow bows to fall out. The area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn. Actual use of the item is difficult; replacing items after use tore the "assigned" compartment even more.I'm looking for another storage solution, this one did not work.
__label__1 Cheap material and poorly designed: I really loved the idea of this item. I purchased this item after loving theJokari Gift Bag Organizer, Whiteand wanted it's sister product!. I was very disappointed with the hanging gift wrap organizer. First of all, it was much smaller than I had imagined. But that's my own fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions. Next, The plastic was cheap and flimsy. Finally, the whole thing was just poorly designed. I placed about 6 rolls of paper (3 on each side), and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided. Even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper. I can't imaging using it for 12 rolls of paper, as the description claims that it can. I ended up returning it, and purchasing a tall plastic storage container by sterilite to stand in the corner of my closet to hold my gift wrap.
__label__1 The Reader's Dilemma: My dilemma was whether to finish this annoying book or not. My choice was to finish it, hoping it would be redeemed by the clarification of Jackson's Dilemma at last. It was not.I found the dialogue repetitive, overly sentimental, hard to follow (like very bad stream of consciousness)and the characters, other than Owen and Jackson, uninteresting people with too little to do and too much time to think about it.There was some plot resemblence to A Midsummer Night's Dream, or A Winter's Tale, but in this book at least, Iris Murdoch is no Shakespeare.Unfortunately for me, this was my first Iris Murdoch. It will be awhile before I pick up another.
__label__2 looks great: Looks great, and is durable. Only problem with it i have found is the clear plastic piece on top of the black cover can break, so be careful with it. It is great for the price and perfect for a bar where the blender will be visible.
__label__2 Enjoying the OMD5s: I ordered these a few days ago and I've been very pleased so far. 9 pounds or so of weight, fairly easy to mount on the wall with the included hanging screw and screw-in attachment. I recommend this if the OMD15 floor-standing speaker is too large.
__label__2 Christian Martial Arts 101 is a must-have book!: Excellent book! It is a must-have for every Christian martial artist and instructor. Wendy Williamson has done a wonderful job of explaining what it means to be a Christian martial artist. Her 101 lessons for students is a great help to busy instructors. Wendy has done the work for us! Her experience as an educator and martial arts instructor comes together in a marvelous understanding of what and how to teach the important aspects of spirituality and martial arts science. I highly recommend this book!
__label__2 Overlooked gem!: Just got this on vinyl after having the MP3s. Don't think you can buy the LP through Amazon, but this is an overlooked piece of the mid-aughts "freak folk" movement... though this has a lot more melody than some of its contemporaries, & certainly some great, psych-*rock* fuzztones, cryptic lyrics & excellent arrangements. Glad I was turned on to it!
__label__2 An excellent book with real application: Mr. Dallas combines his experience with the power of God's word to provide men with a valuable tool to maintain or gain sexual integrity from pornography, adultery, or whatever temptation has taken control in their lives. This book is part devotional and part action plan, it does not just tell you everything that is wrong in your life it provides you step by step actions to fix it. If you struggle with temptation, I highly recommend this book.
__label__1 Oatmeal Shampoo: Not as natural of a product as I intended. Smells like pine-sol. Very disappointed. Does lather well. And I don't like being told how many words I need to leave in a review.
__label__2 Very Happy - But Consider Adding 8 Iced Tea Spoons: The set is very nice, have had for over a year now and they still are on good condition, as expected.I like them enough that today, I'm purchasing another 42-piece set to increase my settings from 8 to 16 to keep one matching set as well as 1 hostess set and 8 iced tea spoons.The downside of this set compared to some other lower end items is there are no "special" items are included in the box aside from the large fork & spoon. If you want to stir drinks or other stuff, the short dessert spoons are not long enough to accomplish this. I recommend buying 2 sets of 4 iced tea spoons to accompany this set.
__label__2 good quality, nice looking flatware: I purchasedMikasa Classico Satin 42-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 8for my mother to replace her old set. She loved the style and look of this set. The quality is not hard to notice just by holding in your hand. I am impressed with this product and my mother thinks the world of the set.
__label__1 Hack//signs is way too slow: This series is extremely slow. I saw the whole japanese series I would say it was sorry. I really don't recomend this series to anybody. The whole series is all walking around and conversating about how to find a key and wonder why Tsukasa can't go back to the real world. This whole series is all dialogue. There is only like a couple fighting scenes near the end. It is so slow, I have never seen something so slow...If you want to be left opened at the end of the series be my guest and buy the whole series. One of my most pet peeve in this series is that there is alot of unneeded flash back. It was so bad that one of the chapter was just all flashback (what a waste of my time).Only reason I am not giving it a one star rating is the intro to the series is one of the best I have ever seen and also the soundtrack is [good]. I also love how the character design.
__label__2 Golf Anniks's Way: I am a male that has worked hard mentally, physically and with a golf pro to reduce my high handicap by 10 strokes. The text and photography do a great job of instruction. The transition from the top and backswing as well as iniating the downswing translate into swing improvment. I also liked finding the balls of your feet for balance.I work hard at physical fitness and her chapter Getting Fit was very helpful. Strong to the core on the fitness ball and the med ball twist was great. I am aware of my abs on practice swings for the first time. I recomend this book for a golfer at any level, and believe readers will be suprised at it's quality.
__label__1 Poor Planning: It's difficult to tell if my birds would like to shred the balls because the cord is twine and both my cockatoos had the balls on the cage floors within minutes. They really need to use chains or something more indestructible.
__label__1 Too many bugs!: Okay... the first few levels were fun, especially the level with the teenaged Lara in one of her first adventures. However, "Red Alert" has so many bugs in it that I finally gave up playing in despair. I've never given up on a game before, but this was finally more frustrating than fun.
__label__2 Who says SK isn't fun?: While I look with horror at the whole Philosophy in 90 minutes series, if you had to do it for SK this is how you could best do it. A wonderful little book for dipping into, full of short witty aphorisms taken from SK's works. Of course everything is out of context, but then SK tended to set these witty little stories in very intimidating tomes. In any case, this book provides a nice place to start and the references allow you to find the parables in the context of the works themselves.
__label__1 Disappointing and Broken: Everything started out fine, but within 3 weeks my machine was unusable. Recording was easy from my camcorder, though I never got it to work with my VCR; playback has been a nightmare - progressively over the last 2 weeks my machine has been getting worse and worse: freezing and skipping are the primairy problems with, now, such frequency, I can't watch anything. I've tried different DVD's and to no avail. I've tried cleaning, to no avail. I'm just returning my machine to Amazon, hopefully for a refund so I can choose another manufacturer. If you plan on using this only for recording from you camcorder- this is the machine for you. Otherwize pick another unit.
__label__1 2006 calendar is off by a day!!!: I recently bought one and found out immediately that I could not set the date completely. You can set the day, month, year and time, but not the day of the week. It seems there is an internal calendar on this unit and it is behind by a day for 2006. 2005 was fine and I set a future date in 2007 and that was fine. This makes useless the settings like "MON-FRI" and "SAT-SUN", while "EVERY-$DAY" can be adjusted by one day off but you still have to remember that.As someone else mentioned, the audio/video sync is sometimes off as well.A plus is that this unit is very easy to use and I like its menu system but the two problems after only a week means that I am returning the unit and going for the Toshiba R4.
__label__1 Disks do not play on other video players: The disks recored on this player will not play on other players or a computer drive. This is a major problem for me since I bought the machine with this in mind. Should have read reviews first. However, other than that limitation the device works well, I've only tried it in 2 hour mode so far. The functions and set up are very easy.
__label__1 Fun but small: My daughter likes to play with them anyway, but for the price these should have been much bigger. We get better ones that are bigger and not all in the same pose at the dollar store.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF @)*)#$: i bought this DVD player about a year and half ago because it had a glowing review on CNET. I bought it and it often skipped or froze with certain DVDs. I figured they were just scratched DVDs, but I have now realized that this thing overheats and skips or freezes with almost all DVDs. I can't watch more than 1/3 of a movie without it overheating and skipping and/or freezing.
__label__1 Not a fully debugged product: Installed quicky over a clean install of CFS2. Several missions had major bugs including planes that would not start and missing library files. Other missions were impossible to end even when the mission goals were met (warp disabled) unless you flew manually back to base. Additional problems when you tried to change payload from the default. A frustrating experience, especially when I found no patches at Abacus' website.
__label__1 she's not so great: while her poetry isn't the worst i've read, graham's isn't that great... her poems drag on, all could be cut by about half or even a third. she seems to forget just what the english language can do in the hands of a master, because her poems are flat and i've heard of people talking about her work being difficult. i think they confuse difficult with nothing to say.
__label__1 Customer Service Neglect -Hello! Anybody work there!!!: Recently purchased Magix E-Version on line. Continued problems loading, which in all fairness happens, however repeated (3 days straight) trys to contact by email and phone never got me any closer to help than finally an Operator who left me in Muzak Limbo and then transferred me to Tech Support. who I had already repeatedly found to be never there. Interface is confusing and Help manual is vague and not helpful!!! Going to eat the $25 and find a more user friendly and (Customer Friendly) company and software.
__label__1 Bad news!: Item was not packaged properly and was broken in shipment. Could not get any response from seller!Had to contact Amazon direct. They were very good and did credit my credit card for this item. Very pleased with Amazon's action.Charles & Sanny Sue
__label__1 no rise: I tried one of the recipes in the enclosed cookbook, as well as muffin mix from the supermarket. I used self-rising flour as instructed. In both cases, the muffins would not rise.I was very disappointed.
__label__1 Failed attempt also: I just tried the exact same muffin mix {Krusteaz} and low fat banana. HORRIBLE. I don't know if it is the mix or the muffin magic. The reviews are what sold me on it so I will try it again. I followed the instructions exactly, oiled the cups, waited for ready light; muffins looked great, golden brown on outside but raw on inside and tough.
__label__1 Please, say it ain't so!: I read the book, and this follows it in about one place. They go back in time. This is so ridiculous it doesn't even deserve a long review. If you didn't read the book the game makes no sense.Some of the puzzles are so simple they are hard because you would never expects the damn thing to be so easy. The game is very short. There is absolutely no violence. When you hit someone with a sword, they surrender, not die. COME ON! The worst part is that Michael Crichton himself directed the project, why he would ever do that, and disgrace his book (which is very good). Just read the book and digest it, DON'T PLAY THE GAME. It RUINS THE BOOK. Thank you for your time. Now leave this page of the website and ask for forgiveness from G-d for even considering buying this book.
__label__2 Good, but not what I expected.: Timeline is certainly not what I expected it to be. First off, it is a very simple game that anyone could beat. I am not a big gamer, but I still found it very easy. If you are buying this game because you are a fan of the book, you may want to reconsider. Although it is easy, you need a really good graphics card and a fast computer to get the most out of Timeline. I have a 266MHz Celron with 64MB of RAM, and I found the game very slow on my computer. After about 2 minutes, the game would freeze up, and it took a while to respond to my moves. Despite all these drawbacks, Timeline does have excellent graphics. The music is even better. It sounds like a theme song from a movie (it will hopefully be in the Timeline movie coming out this fall). Overall, Timeline is a very good game, but people who aren't big gamers, and don't have computers designed for lots of gaming, should stay away from it.
__label__2 I don't understand: I am Allison. I want to be a model. Could you possibly give me a round-trip ticket to visit your agency? I am the person you are looking for. I live in Orange Park, Florida. my number is (904) 635-3125. Glamour shots has pictures of me. You can also contact Nikki Hall @ Barbizon Atlanta, Georgia. Thank you for your prompt attention.good day, allison "ally"
__label__1 What a bore!: Yet again, readers can hear the tired ideas about self-esteem, and receive the message that a plus-size lady can do whatever she pleases ... as long as it is exercise. Emme further reinforces the absurd stereotypes about "relationships with food" in her childhood reminiscences. Enough! In an era where so many women are obsessed with food, we do not need more time to dwell on the matter. Let's feed and exercise our intelligence for a change.
__label__1 Worthless: I accidentally left some food in the wok on a Friday, went out of town and got back on a Wednesday, and the wok was ruined.The "teflon" was peeling like 50 year old paint. What a bad joke.
__label__2 Fantastic Electric Woik: We've had the Electric Wok now for a couple of weeks and it is everything we hoped for and more !It heats up hot and fast. We are going crazy trying all the different Stir Fry possibilities. It'snon-stick feature is amazing. Definitely would recommend this !!
__label__2 Power of French Hip-Hop: This album is just a short explanation of how powerful French hip hop is getting... It's full of great beats and melodies... If you're like me and you don't care that much about the lryics, coz I can't speak French, these rappers are just the best for you. I hope they get to be more famous in Europe so we can get some CDs in the future...
__label__2 Race to the bottom: Another book of wisdom and common sense to those who have lost their minds in the day to day life.
__label__2 Cute... but not made for thick antennas.: I feel sorry for poor Smiley. I really have put off placing him on my antenna because I would have to widen the bottom hole in order for him to fit. And then it worries me he just might fly off if the hole is cut to wide! But the product looks even better than advertised. If you have a regular antenna and are either as passionate as I am about bikes or if you like flying, go right ahead and get one!
__label__2 Amber at her best: I love Amber's new album "Naked." This CD proves that she is not just a dance diva. I particularly love the 3rd track "Anyway (Men Are From Mars)". It's such a catchy song, very different from what I've been hearing out there on the radio. "He", "Love On You" and "The Need To Be Naked" are also very good. I'm disappointed that Amber is not as popular as she should be. She is one underated artist.
__label__1 Disappointing: I was a big Amber fan with her THIS IS YOUR NIGHT and AMBER albums but this CD definetly doesn't have the quality she showed us in the past. There are a few songs that are OK. Yes was not her best single by any means and I didn't care for it too much but at least it had energy.THE NEED TO BE NAKED is just OK. A little cheesy but it has a little energy too. The only problem is it seems like bad teen pop. The only other song worth mentioning is SEX WITHOUT SEX and it is only ok. Maybe if a remixed version were made it could have done well but still a little blah in its original version. The other songs are boring and a waste of time. Don't waste your money on this. If you want dance music look somewhere else. A few of the songs will give you a giggle and make you wonder what she was thinking. THE SMILE OF MY CHILD is one them. Its Horrible with quite a humorous sounding "LAH LAH LAH LAH LAH" that starts the song off.
__label__1 Vinyl: Terrible Quality Master - Get the CD!!: Having listened to the CD and thoroughly enjoyed every track, I figured this one would be a given to enjoy on vinyl. No luck. First off, --==No Bass==--. This is 180G vinyl, and there's not the slightest floor-shaking frequency to be found anywhere. Worse still, it was mastered so hot, the vocals and horns distort in numerous places. This was played on a table/stylus proven to diminish groove distortion to near imperceptible levels, so I'm sure it's not the equipment.Get the CD, because every track is a winner, if you like dub. Avoid the vinyl at all costs!
__label__1 DISAPOINTED: I was interested in these bras-this bra line after seeing on tv. I recieved and even though they are for the most part comfortable and breath...they do not have enough modesty coverage in the lining of the cup at all. Larger chest sizes need to have extra lining because it also helps with support. So I am not happy as I hoped to be by this product. But I give two stars because they are made very very well...just not enough support for me.
__label__2 My first and best intro to green living: I picked up this book shortly after it came out, and I still use it today. I learned that you don't need 20 different solutions to clean house. For most tasks, I learned that I make do with vinegar and baking soda. Save time, save money, save our planet!Pamela S. BeasonAuthor of SAVE Your Money, Your Sanity, and Our Planet; 5 Lessons and 125 Tips for a Thrifty Lifestyle
__label__1 Not very happy with the book: I purchased this book yesterday and when I began reading it today, the pages fell out as I turned the pages. In addition, it says Vitamin E is a preservative. It is NOT. Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant (keeps oils from rancidity). If you make a product that mostly consists of water with added "food" for bacteria which include tea or herbal infusions, than it either needs to be refrigerated, or preserved with a REAL preservative or you could run the risk of growing bacteria and mold in the very product you are hoping is good for your home. Not to mention getting the contaminated home made product on an open cut or wound and ending up with a bacterial blood infection, or worse. Also Grapefruit seed extract is not a preservative either. It is preserved with a preservative which makes people assume it works.
__label__1 Horrible: I have a purchased Wolfgang-Puck wild chicken-wild rice soup before and really liked it, and based on my previous experience ordered 20 cans of this roasted chicken & fine herbs soup from Amazon. Big mistake- it tastes horrible. Blindfolded, I can make better soup any day. Soup is very salty to my taste. Chickens are hard to find among the maze of gooey white balls. Not recommended.
__label__1 If you enjoy Wheel of Fortune, DON'T BUY THIS!!: We own WOF 1 and have a lot of fun with it. So, we figured the 2nd edition would be even better, right? Wrong. Vanna looks like some 2-year-old cut her cardboard picture off a cereal box and pasted her on the cheesy, fake-looking background. The sound stinks, the game play is nauseatingly slow. I will say this, however. The graphics on the CD cover are pretty good, and the box itself has an attractive layout. It will look really good on the shelf of your computer desk -- which is where you will leave it when you uninstall it from your hard drive after you suffer through your first game.
__label__2 I can now throw out my toaster oven...this does it all!: I LOVE this product! We have used it to make everything from regular toast to french toast, panini's, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. It's easy to clean, heats quickly and does everything it claims. I have thrown out my toaster and toaster oven. This is all you need on your counter :)
__label__1 It's an ok product but dog doesn't care for it!: The product is satisfactory to me but not to my dog. She refuses to use it. I have coaxed her up the stairs with a treat at the top, but she uses the stairs reluctantly. Not at all, if there is no treat there. She is a stubborn dachshund.
__label__1 Throw a wet blanket over your speakers...: and this will give you an idea of the sound quality you will get from this particular product. While it delivers as far as getting your MP3 player to play through you cassette system, the very poor and muffled sound quality offsets this benefit. As far as cassette adapters go, I've gone through a few and the Sony brand has delivered far superior sound quality at the same price. While Maxell does make fine quality cassette tapes, I would avoid their cassette adapter.
__label__1 Heartburn.: I have made several shakes with cocoa powder, whey, agave syrup, and non-fat milk (my normal mixture) and ended up with heartburn. I have used another natural brand of whey with these same ingredients for months with no problems, so I suspect this brand might be the culprit. It does mix well.
__label__2 fairly technical but interesting book on fossil birds: Chatterjee does a great job in presenting his case for Protoavis, a bird that may very well precede the famous Archaeopteryx of the Jurassic. Though a bit technical at times, it has a good overview of bird evolution and of fossil birds throughout the Mesozoic and throughout the Cenozoic, with excellent coverage of many Tertiary species, especially at Green River(from the Eocene of Wyoming) and Messel (from the Eocene of Central Europe). Their relationship to dinosaurs is well covered, and some time is spent on the K/T event that ended much Mesozoic life. Numerous diagrams and illustrations and a thorough bibliography. While not all may agree with his take on Protoavis, this remains a worthwhile on avian evolution and fossil bird speciesA good book.
__label__2 Excellent Juicer: This is a great juicer and does a great job of extracting the juice even from whole fruits.
__label__2 amazing: I read many comments on amazon and bought it and it just arrived today. We tested some apples and orages. It is just amazing, very powerful, pancy design, and produce pure joice.We are very happy with this great Je900.If you find a good juice maker,just buy this model today!!
__label__2 Excellent: Excellent juicer, very powerful, the feet chute is wide enough to accomodate even medium sized apples and large cucumbers as well. It's not as loud as I expected and meshes aesthetically with my other modern appliances. The pulp is bone dry (with a slower juicing hand) and a lot of juice is extracted from each piece of fruit/vegetable. All in all it was money well spent and is a product I use often. It's also very easy to clean!
__label__2 Yes, it's that's good: I had one of those big yellow ugly juicers that I never used because it was so bulky and difficult to clean. This juicer is so much fun that I can't wait to use it. I'm having a glass of freshly made grape juice (with a couple of carrots thrown in) for dessert now...and I'm losing weight. It really is good enough to satisfy your sweet tooth after dinner without all the calories. The juicer is loud, as others have noted, but you don't have it on long because it works so quickly. And the parts really are very easy to clean. They even include a nice custom brush for cleaning the filter. What impressed me most about this was the engineering. It's one of the best-designed appliances I've ever seen. I'm now going to check in to other products made by Breville. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 Anthony Worrell Thompson breville juicer 850watts power!: I like to research the products i buy. I came across this juicer on the australian site for breville. Eventually i was able to track down the distributers in england. Its the best purchase i have made. It is not too noisy at all and is very easy to use. the juice is very concentrated and tastes really good. To clean it is a brease. well worth the money.
__label__1 I really didn't like this juicer: This is the first Amazon review I have written. I bought this juicer after seeing how popular it is, but I returned it after one use. This is a beautiful and fast appliance, but I don't think the juice is as healthy other "older" juicers out there. Plus, I really hated the noise. I felt like I was killing a small animal.I did a froth/taste test with an old school Champion juicer and the Breville juice 1) had TONS more frothy stuff, 2) didn't taste as rich, 3) had parts that were easy to clean, but TOO big. I'm much happier with my hand-me-down Champion.If you are juicing a couple times a week for yourself and want the healthiest juice possible (enzymes included!), DON'T buy the Breville. It's a pretty package without any personality.
__label__2 One of My Favorite Books: This is a book that really sneaks up on you - making you feel things as the main character feels them. At twelve, Annemarie (Shug) Wilcox is just beginning the journey from child to adult. Her newly discovered maturity makes Shug look at all of the people in her life with a precocious clarity. Her critical, heavy-drinking mother, mostly absent father and seemingly perfect older sister are all revealed to be both more and less than Shug has always believed.As she struggles with a romantic attraction to her best friend, Mark and a budding friendship with bad-boy Jack, Shug learns to really see herself, as well as the people around her. Anyone who had a less than perfect passage through their Junior High Years will find that Shug speaks directly to their heart. I ached for her as author Jenny Han told the story with a sensitivity and vibrancy that brought every scene vividly to life.
__label__1 Worst Book Ever: I picked up this book because of the cover, but it wasn't as exciting as the cover looked. It had a bad story line, it wasn't suspensful, and it wasn't interesting at all!! I would not have finished this boook if it wasn't for a school assignment.
__label__2 A winner!: I played violin as a young child for 3 years and always wanted to get back to it but felt a little intimidated. Using this book is very enjoyable and makes it seem easy. I'll soon be moving on to Book 2 level. Can't wait!Getting the CD to this book 1 was a good decision too. Fun to play along with.
__label__2 Good for beginners: In order to teach my daughters and some of their friends, I purchased this book and Suzuki vol 1. I find that this book is much more basic than the Suzuki and will make a very nice starter. As mentioned, the CD does not appear to be in order, but if you put it on your computer, you can see and print out the score (violin and piano) which was a really nice surprise. It's like getting the piano accomp. book for free. I would guess that this book is best used with an instructor. A student teaching themselves, might want to supplement with some online video type lessons.
__label__2 Big Love: I must rate this one a "big love!" While I love "that other" female bail bondsman writer, I prefer this one :-) Smarter writing, tighter plotting. Chris rocks it.
__label__2 Bitch Factor: I was glad that I finally found it. Had the other 2 books and needed this one to complete my collection. Fast Delivery and I really enjoyed it. Thanks!!!!
__label__2 Bruce Lee, the man... the legend.: This is a very good book if you are looking for a good work out routine.
__label__2 Excellent book but not quite what i thought it would be: this book although extremely informative and easy to understand, describes techniques using alot of specialist equipment which is no good to anyone without them
__label__1 Why can't I choose 0 or negative stars....: Ok, I am a huge Jane's fan. Own everything they have put out and some random covers by others. I thought this might be actually an interesting twist, some electronica/dance grooves covering JA. [...]. Don't waste your money. I think I am going to destroy it as a tribute to a band that deserves much better.I mean, come on! Honest to God, it sounds like some kids sat in their bedroom with a synthesizer keyboard and sang some Jane's lyrics. Think Divo (early 80's), covering Janes Addiction and then take away any real talent that Divo had.I was hoping for maybe more of a Dirty Vegas, Crystal Method, or Fatboy Slim (Norman Cook) DJ sound... not quite. I can't say enough about how bad this is. Just listen to the clips and you will cringe. I just regret I bought it in a store before listening to it. STAY AWAY!
__label__1 Publ Adv Copy (pb) Sent as Hardback: The copy I received is a paperback publisher's advance copy. The description specified that it was a hardcover copy. Very bad.
__label__2 Excellent learing tool: Anyone interesting in becoming a sports broadcaster should buy this book. Schultz does an excellent job describing the 'real' workings of sportcasting. He describes both the role of talent along with the vital workings of production. I would highly recommend this book to any broadcast writing professor.
__label__2 The Indian casualties: The author sifts thru numerous Lakota, Cheyenne, and White accounts of the Battle of the Little Bighorn in an attempt to come up with an accounting of the Native American casualties in that battle. Those accounts are often incomplete, contradictory, or altered in various ways by the White interviewers of these veterans. And in some cases the interviews were conducted many decades after the events described. Indeed, some of the Native participants lived into the 1940s and 50s and were still offering memories even then to various interviewers about who was killed when and where. The author concludes that a total of 31 Indian men were killed in the Custer and Reno engagements of this battle. That seems a ludicrously low number, given that several thousand targets were on the field and that several hundred troopers were firing on them. It suggests both superior tactics on the part of the Indians and inferior marksmanship and a breakdown of command on the part of the troopers.
__label__1 Absolute garbage: This has been my biggest waste of time yet. first off, the body work is cheesy and cheap, my car was missing the bottom half of the suspension, which left my left rear spring just dangling and not supporting the chasis. the tires are as crooked as ever no matter what you do, you can rip them off and put them back on but all you'll get is a wobbly piece of junk. finally, i spent 5 days tuning and doing everything a nitro rc car enthusiast would, but this car wouldn't start at all. i've been doing nitro rc's for 4 years now, and i've never spent more than a few minutes tuning a car to start. i picked this up to be used for stunts and i can't even get it to run. returning is a joke. i finally tested how durable and threw it out a 3 story windows about 6 times. it can tolerate a beating and can be used as a rock, but those are free. DON'T WASTE TIME ON THIS CRAP. I regret buying this car
__label__2 Beautiful music: You just can't beat Conway for beautiful music. This is a great album. I have it downloaded on my kindle and listen to it where ever I go.
__label__2 Great DVD: If you like great guitar talent you gotta add this to your collection. Just getting back into the guitar after 30 years and Gary Moore, Joe Bonamassa, Eric Johnson and Kenny Wayne Sheppard have been real inspirations to an old arthritic wanna-be musician. Gary was a great loss. Check out the DVDs from these other artists.
__label__1 Never got it...: 1 month and 2 days later i still havent recieved this product. Ill find it elsewhere.
__label__2 Great HDMI cable for the price: I use this cable with my Panasonic AE-PT3000U projector, a sony blu-ray and Onkyo TX-SR706 receiver in a theater room. The sound and picture are superb. Excellent quality connections.
__label__1 SMELLS LIKE GAS!!: I ordered this cover because i bought one previously from auto zone for my old car and love this kind of cover because ofthe grip, now i cant find them anywhere. HOWEVER, when i got the cover i opened it and it had a heavy chemical smell to it so i left it out side the wednesday before thanksgiving till now ( over a week later), and needless to say the cover still has a strong chemical smell!!! even though the smell was not as bad, when i tried to put it in my car (sebring limited coupe), my car filled with he toxic smell of the cover!! i don't like the smell, and im going to go to the store and see if i can find the cover there. ill pay $2 more at the store, if that saves me from this death defying smell. I CANT TAKE IT!!! it also has my hands smelling like whatever chemical they soaked it in b4 sending. Im very disappointed!!!
__label__2 Worth Watching: Boy, has television advertising changed over the years.If you are used to the gloss, color CGI ads that dominate the tube today you'll be shocked at what ads were like when television was first starting out.What they lack in techiclal details these ads more than make up for in how creative they were. They clearly didn't know what would work and what wouldn't so they tried every different type of approach they could think of.The quality of the footage is surprisingly good considering how old the clips are.
__label__2 Pretty nice for the price: Fit well and seem to be of good quaity. They are not my favorite old pair of shoes that they are meant to replace but they will do. The price was very reasonable as well.
__label__1 kindergarten lace: I was not impressed with this book. The opening paragraph states that Mary had collected lace patterns all of her life. Surely she had collected somethings that were prettier than the plain, boring and very 'solid'(Meaning, very little actual lace in the patterns) doilies exemplified in this book. Of the entire book there were only two doilies with which I would consider bothering.
__label__2 Great little side companion to milk-eyed mender: If you love Joanna's unique sound and lyrics like those heard on her last full-length "The Milk-Eyed Mender" then you'd probably appreciate this two track disc which contains a more heartfelt and less 'studio' version of 'Sprout and the Bean' as well as an unreleased track 'What We Have Known' which I think is a great track and likely ranked amongst her best works.
__label__1 Not solid built. Could be better for this price.: It is a good mouse and the installation is not hard. this mouse looks good and feels nice in hand. I use left hand mouse so there are not much choices for me. I will give it a better star if it is built with a better quality.The problem I have is: the left click of the mouse (which is the primary key since I use left hand) feels diffrent from the right click. The left button is hard to pressed down compared to the right button, and there is a squick of plastic rub against plastic when I click the button.I thought this may only happened to me since I did not see anybody else complained about it.But for a mouse at this price I really expect something build more solid and better quality.
__label__1 Middle mouse button worthless!: I have a laptop with Bluetooth built-in and I wanted a full-size Bluetooth mouse to use with it.Many of the applications I use rely heavily on the middle mouse button. Unfortunately, the middle button on this mouse does not respond properly, making for a very frustrating experience.Also, the clickless wheel sounds like a good idea, but I enjoy a little tactile feedback from the wheel.Why can't Microsoft simply take their nice, basic mouse, and make a Bluetooth version of it without trying to add a bunch of new "features" to try and justify the high price?
__label__2 Wonderful Story telling...magnificent story: I was moved to pick up this book after seeing the author on TV speaking about his life long love of the 76's. So, I thought the book would be a great gift for the men in my life (for birthdays, Father's Day, and the like.) Well, I thumbed through a copy in the bookstore, and, after reading the introduction, I was hooked--and I'm a girl...way too young to remember anything about 1967. Still, Mr. Lynch's writing is as engaging as his TV appearance was, and, he really loves Wilt Chamberlain and his team...If I could be interested in this book because of it's great story and prose, ANYBODY would love it...and, if that person happens to be a guy between the ages of oh, say, 43 and up (old enough to recall the 1967 season of the 76's...) he will be especially happy to have this book around. It's a great sports story told exceptionally well.
__label__2 MS-65 Book: Year in and year out, this is one of the better books on coins for new and experienced collectors alike. Could use some analysis on why certain coins are priced as they are. Also, could use more information regarding coin history.
__label__2 Well done, based on the Jack Finney Story of the same name.: It was based on the short story by Jack Finney. When I first saw it I knew it had a ring to it, but then I remembered. I adore Mr. Finney's work but must admit. I like the ending in this one much better :D. Excellent love story, for the true romantic
__label__1 Not same class as "Somewhere In Time": I stumbled upon this as I searched for a copy of "Somewhere in Time". The outstanding 5-star reviews led me to order it, even though it was comparatively expensive. What a sucker. Made for TV, this movie just doesn't ever allow the suspension of disbelief. The dialogue is weak, the acting forced and unconvincing and the technical aspects just silly (like the soap-opera recovery from prolonged traumatic coma). No music. No magic. Rent if you must (if you can find it) but save your money.
__label__1 Unbelievably hokey and cheezy!: Usually, i love Hallmark movies, but this one was very disappointing. I bought this video because of reviews I read on this site. The story line is so incredibly unrealistic and hokey that i could not even focus on the acting. I'm all for love and romance stories, but this one crossed the line. It was so predictably lame. The only entertaining thing about it was making fun of it with my friends as we watched. I feel very sad to have to give this kind of review for a Hallmark movie, but i would hate for anyone else to waste their time and money as i did. If you are in the least bit a realistic person, do not get this movie!
__label__2 ONE OF THE BEST ROMANTIC STORIES EVER!!!!!!: From the first time I saw this movie I was in love with it. The story weaves from past to present so fluently you can almost imagine that Scott and Elizabeth's lives are running simultaneously. It is definately a four tissue movie. This is a must see for all who believe in true love and destiny. Enjoy!!!!
__label__1 Guide? Guide to where?: This book is filled with generalities and unspecific instructions. If you want to build a rifle this book will do little more than frustrate you. The sketches leave a lot to be desired. there are missing dimensions, missing lines, missing hidden lines, missing drawings. Bill you are no engineer or draftsman, if you are going to publish a book don't be so cheap and hire someone that can take photos and draw (preferably with a CADD program, maybe even a drafting board.)If you know nothing this book maybe helpful.
__label__1 Vile and depressing: This book is not badly written. But the content is so depressing and the incidents so vile that it makes for a miserable read. There is no relief, no oppotunirty to recover from one grim episode before lurching into the next.It is the school of gritty realism. Psychopaths rule London's Underworld. The dysfunctional "hero" - D.S. Stella Mooney, is not sympathetic. Nobody is. This collection of characters are enough to make a person lose their faith in human nature.I do not like giving up on a book but finally lost my patience just over half way through. The incident between Steve Tanner and DS Mooney in the pub finished me off. It offended me beyond my endurance. The final straw. And the book went in the trash.I wish I had not bought this book. I hated it. And I don't recommend it.
__label__1 For South Park Fans, This Just Isn't Worth Your Time: South Park - The Chef Experience is NOT a good video to buy. If you happen to rent it, then great. However, even a die-hard fan would be greatly disappointed in this video.For the most part, South Park is funny, alarming, and full of sly and overt commentary. But The Chef Experience is not a regular episode tape that you'll love (like Insults To Injuries). Instead, it plays like a bad VH1 Behind The Music special, which just isn't good.I love South Park and enjoy most of their episodes. The Chef Experience is Not one of those I enjoyed and I suspect you wouldn't either.
__label__2 South Park: If ur a south park fan. this DVD is a "must have"!!! Since Chef is my favorite character, i really enjoyed this DVD, i saw the episodes again and again!!!
__label__1 This is the worst DVD player I've ever owned: - It takes around fifteen seconds (!) to begin viewing a DVD after inserting it- The pause while switching layers on a dual-layer DVD is longer than on other players I've owned- It will randomly freeze while playing audio CDs (this is not a problem with the discs - they are in pristine condition and can be played by any other CD/DVD player in the house)- Front panel buttons are poorly designed (there are no menu navigation buttons, but there's a 'video select' button to switch between outputs? Who uses that more than once a year?) and don't always seem to function as expected (pressing the Power button doesn't seem to do anything while the disc tray is open).
__label__1 Problem Reading Some DVDs: I have had the same problem others have mentioned in their reviews. On occasion with certain dvds the movie will begin to pixelate, freeze, skip, etc. It seems to be related to overheating because if I shut the unit off for a few minutes and turn it back on it will play fine again for 20-30 minutes, then start screwing up again. I even tried giving it more aiir circulation but it didnt seem to help. I am returning it the store and exchanging it for a Sony DVP-NS75H. I did give it two stars because when it was working the picture was outstanding even using the S-video output.
__label__1 Charlie and Ronald Lauder: This conversation with Charlie Rose and Ronald Lauder was very enlightening. I will use it in a class on "Jews on Trial" where I will discuss the Adele Boch-Bauer Affair. I am sure the group will find it very intersting. I learned some things I didn't know even though I had researched the matter.
__label__1 It's just 'ok': I bought the video after seeing Valerie Bertinelli talking about it on the Rachel Ray show this summer. They made it sound very exciting and effective. I like parts of it, but my biggest problem is that it's almost entirely focused on squats and lunges. Don't get me wrong - I understand that squats and lunges are effective exercises. However, this makes me reflect on the video negatively for two reasons: 1) I already do plenty of squats and lunges already. I don't need $9.00 DVD to tell me that they're important, and 2) After finishing the DVD, I didn't feel that the rest of my body got nearly the workout that my legs did. This DVD would probably be helpful if you just need to be reminded to do squats and lunges, but overall was lacking in originality and comprehensiveness.
__label__1 I fell for the other reviews: Save your money - don't bother with this one. It's pure tripe from beginning to end. Awful, just awful. Couldn't listen to a whole cut all the way through.
__label__1 No es de Saint Germain: Si bien el bendito Maestro Ascendido Saint Germain habló de muchas cosas en la Enseñanza Espiritual que descargó en el siglo XX para beneficio de la humanidad, la "metafísica" no fue una de ellas... y mucho menos preguntas y respuestas sobre qué es la metafísica!Esta editorial está utilizando el nombre del amado Saint Germain para publicar quien sabe qué material de vaya-usted-a-saber qué origen.Dicho en pocas palabras: Este libro NO ES del Maestro Saint Germain. ATENCIÓN BUSCADORES SINCEROS DE LA LUZ!!!
__label__2 AMAZING!! BRAVO: I came across Pike's books 'bout 3 years ago. Since then i've been reading all his books!! However, recently i've been looking high and low for his latest books published since 1998. Any idea how i can get hold of them???
__label__1 shipping a total rip off: The price for the item is reasonable. The quality of the item is excellent. The shipping costs aren't displayed on the selling page. The shipping costs are more than the cost of the item. Do not buy with one click
__label__2 Easy to use but: Its easy to use but if you get a Texas Instruments TI-84 it will have different controls than this one.
__label__1 I can't believe they are actually selling this terrible product!: I bought an Airplay2 from am Apple store for around $60. Other than the fact that "blank" FM stations are hard to find in the New York Metropolitan area, and that you need to keep changing to different "blank" stations as you drive, the product itself is simply terrible. Even if you are in a parking lot, and find a "blank" FM station, the quality of the music the Airplay broadcasts is very bad. The bass is almost non-existent, and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of. This product is not worth buying, especially for $60.
__label__1 Buy this book just to have to buy another.: I just received this book a day ago. And I've read 80 pages just to find out, I have to also purchase TRAILERS - HOW TO BUY & EVALUATE and VOLUME 3, to find out more information on how to design and build a trailer. I thought this book was titled "HOW TO DESIGN AND BUILD TRAILERS". The book has good information so far, but all through the book it tells you there is more information on this in another book. It's ridiculous. They could have fit everything on design and building a trailer in this book. Seems they want you to buy all four books for all the information, when they could have put into one.
__label__1 Overpriced and not as powerful as the Power 2000 NiMH AAs: Don't waste your money on these Canon batteries. They're rated for only 2100 mAH (milliAmp Hours).J&R; Music carries the Power 2000 NiMH AA batteries (part# XP4AA-27). These are rated at 2700 mAH, and they're priced about 40% less. It takes a LOT of photo shooting to tire out those babies. I STRONGLY recommend them for digital cameras.
__label__1 Expensive and non-functional: I trust Canon products, always have. I bought these very pricey batteries for my newly purchased Canon S2 IS camera. I put 'em in, no charge. Ok, charged 'em up, put 'em in, they were good for about 5 pictures. Recharged them, they were good for about 4 pictures. I'm charging them a third time...guess we'll see, but so far standard-issue, CHEAP AA batteries are lasting far far longer. I'm sure I got a bad batch, but nonetheless, I paid $$ for a BAD batch of batteries...
__label__1 Read the book, it is much better.: I bought this DVD to use as a comparison for the book by the same title. As a stand alone it probably would be a good film, but compared to the original book by the same title - it was awful. So much of the story lines were changed and some of the film was chopped up that it didn't make sense from the book.
__label__1 Stick with the original: While interesting, this version is over the top in areas that simply don't contribute to the story. Captain Towers in unbelievable as a nuclear navy sub commander. Julian Osborne is unbelievable as a government scientist. Moira Davidson is unbelievable as anything other than a complete bitch. The only characters that improved with this telling are Peter and Mary.As noted in previous reviews, the tech flaws include a blinking corpse. In addition, when Bill Gates or Dell comes up with a solar battery powered laptop--someone let me know, OK?Kramers original is still the best. You could hardly go wrong with a cast and script like that.If you're a die hard "End Of The World" film geek like me, then this is a must own. Just don't spend more than US10 on it.
__label__2 DVD On the Beach: The DVD of On the Beach arrived in very good shape and in a shorter time than I expected. We were very pleased with this.
__label__2 Insights to help your business: This great book is a fecund breeding ground for your innovative ideas. Find out what underlies the 10 cravings of the connected generation, why these things are important and how to maximise your use of them. Understand the new consumer and their environment and they will reward your business by.... building your business!
__label__2 Call the company if you have the old single-piece lid: I got this mug for fathers day 2011 and within a few weeks of use the lid was hideous and had water stuck in it that could not be removed. It would appear that i had gotten the mug with the old single-piece lid even though recent reviews make it seem like the lid was redesigned earlier this year to be a two-piece system that allows for easier cleaning. So i called the company to ask about the situation since it was such a recent purchase and they told me to immediately throw away the lid and that they would send a replacement lid to me. The replacement lid arrived within a few weeks and sure enough it was the new redesigned two-piece system which is much easier to clean. I love this mug but I cannot give it 5 stars because it is not dishawasher safe....To anyone having issues with your lid, please call OXO because they apparently do care about what you think. (800)545-4411 [...]
__label__2 Convenient, well sized but poor thermal seal: I got this to take on my bike (just barely fits in a Topeak Modula Ex) since I was getting tired of having cold coffee halfway through class. It's a great size and the cap and button system work great. Unfortunately that same button system ruins the thermal insulation and greatly decreases the amount of time coffee stays hot. You can feel the rubber section in the middle start to heat up almost as soon as you fill it. It stays hot long enough for my purposes, but I'd go somewhere else if you're looking to have a hot cup of coffee 8 hours after filling it.
__label__1 Exploded in my hands: Used it couple of times and did not have major issues except for some occasional spills. But few days ago I poured hot boiled water and closed the lid. I picked it up from the counter in 5 minutes and it exploded in my hands blowing off the plastic and spilling the hot water on me. It burned my fingers and it was very painful. I think it's a design flow since the plastic neck attached to the metal was not able to withstand the high pressure, but I thought thermoses were designed to do exactly that.
__label__2 Must read for EVERYONE planning a trip to Grand Canyon: I read this book the week AFTER I visited the Grand Canyon. I was amazed at the stories in this book. So many pointless deaths due to an "invinceable" mentality. A must read for EVERYONE planning a trip to the Grand Canyon. It is an interesting read that very well may save your life! I didn't even KNOW about the flash flood factor. You won't be able to put this book down.
__label__1 Least entertaining of the Road pictures: Of all the Crosby-Hope road pictures, this one has dated badly and the humor is mostly sophomoric. The boys really hadn't hit their stride yet and this first road outing lacks, through most of its length, the inspired zaniness of Road to Morocco, Utopia, and Rio. Recommended only to those who want all of the Road pictures for the sake of completeness.
__label__2 This is a great item: Based on some reviews that said this box would fall apart, I almost didn't buy it.But I am so glad I did.Putting it together couldn't be easier. Each part is labeled and the bottom piece even tells you which side goes down.You put the bottom down first, then snap in the front and back, then the sides, and finally the top. The whole process from unpacking to using took 10 minutes.And it is huge. I am storing all my camping, hiking, diving and kayaking gear in there.I weigh 210 pounds (hey, I am working on losing it!) and it didn't have any problems with me sitting on it.Very happy I ignored the bad reviews and purchased this box. It is working perfectly for me.
__label__2 LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR DE LOS CACHORROS DE JUAN VILLARREAL: IF YOU WAN'T ALL THE EXITOS FROM JUAN VILLARREAL YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS ALBUM OF COURSE HE HAS SO MANY OF THEM BUT THIS ALBUM FOR SOME REASON TOPS THEM ALL! JUAN VILLARREAL IS TRUELY EL REY DEL ACORDEON!
__label__2 Derek Rules: The Derek May racket is ideal for defensive players who like putting the ball back in play and not making any mistakes. With the acquisition of this racket, you'll notice a great improvement in control play, as Derek guides your shots precisely all around the table. Derek leads to clean and high - quality play, and is one of the best defensive rackets out there. Points will be extended and offensive players will have to hit some brilliant shots before winning a point. The spin is also not bad at all, despite it saying that it's only 45. The speed is good, superior to Derek's bretheren racket Kassam, which is only a piece of plywood.If you're an offensive player who likes heavy topsin and attacking play, then, unfortunately, Derek is not for you. And remember: Defense Wins Championships!Control: 100Spin: 45Speed: 50
__label__2 Just ok: Its not strong in any area, offense or defense. But its a good enough racket to start with. I also found off board playing with looping was ok and its light.
__label__1 rope did not last.: the rope was torn apart in a matter of hours and the ball doesn't interest either dog. I did purchase 5 items and the other 3 so far are fine.
__label__2 My Dog Approves.: This toy is pretty good. bounces well and the dog cant chew through it. If you pull too hard the rope comes out but you can stuff it back in and re-tie it. I might put a newer longer rope thru it when this rope wears out. Or maybe stuff a old sock thru it and tie some knots lol.
__label__2 Finding your mate!: I read several books on gay dating and how to meet Mr. Right. This one, along with Patrick Prices' "Husband Hunting Made Easy" were the best. It has frank, honest commentary about what you need to do to attract Mr. Right. I am happy to say that I have used many ideas from this book, and have found my True Love.
__label__2 Eye-popping illusions!: This is an amazing collection of illusions! I am a vision scientist and have seen quite a lot of visual illusions, but this book contains new illusions that I've never seen before. Fascinating! This collection features the latest in contemporary visual illusions as well as novel twists on classic visual illusions. The color graphics are beautiful, and the illusions are compelling on both a scientific and aesthetic level. My favorite one is on p. 12.
__label__2 Warcraft Jungle Troll: I purchased the Tauren shaman and the Troll voodoo priest. Both transparent. They are cool figures for display purposes. I don't play with them or anything so I can't tell you how much fun that would be but they are cool to look at. I put a blacklight behind them and they look really nice. The only problem I have is that the troll is very hard to stand. The way his legs and feet are shaped it's hard to get him to stand up straight without making him look stupid. If you work at it, you can do it. The shaman looks great but his weapon is huge and doesn't fit in his hand unless you force it. So yeah, after a little work, they both look great in front of a black light.
__label__1 Not erotic, or even interesting: I think an erotic book should first be sexy, and second be a good story. This book tried for plot, and missed both that and any semblance of erotic. I'd definitely skip this one!
__label__2 The best clippers I have ever had.: I have been cutting hair, people and animals for almost 30 years. I can't tell you how many brands of clippers I have gone through over the years. The Oster is the best. Sturdy constructed, easy to use, easy to clean, and the attachments stay on until I take them off!
__label__2 Very helpful!: There are positive, negative and goals phrases very helpful at times. I believe every manager would find some prases that apply to few scenarios at the workplace. But always check with your HR Department to make sure you are following the company's policies.
__label__2 Solving some of life's big questions over coffee at Starbucks...: Rob Brendle's definition and discussion of proactive waiting helps illuminate the misconception that waiting means inactivity. Utilizing well painted word pictures and quoting authors like Steven Covey or Jedi masters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, he describes proactive waiting in such a way that challenges the audience to truly absorb the moment, live life to the fullest, and train for the defining moment when life can move into a"new season." It should be required reading for the twenty to thirtysomething crowd, especially those looking to make the leap of change (college, career, or otherwise), but haven't stepped onto the springboard yet. Listen to the Tank Commander turned Pastor, and be prepared to be entertained as you learn!
__label__1 Unsubtantiated Racist Drivel: This book is full of unsubtantiated racist drivel. The premise is that the Chinese can't play basketball. Lamaar does not source his claims - it's just like that he's making up stuffs from thin air.Regarding his claim that Yao was somehow bred. An Sports Illustrated (SI) article asked why is there only one Yao Ming.Why didn't they "created" more Yao Ming's if what Lamaar claimed is really factual? In case people don't know. Yao is the only child.If you look at other NBA caliber Chinese basketball players such Sun Yue, Yi Jianlian, Tang Zhengdon, Xue Yuyang (drafted by Denver), and even Wang Zhizhi. Their parents were not basketball players.There is no logic to Lamaar's unsubstantiated drivel.
__label__1 It didn't work: The Panasonic phone we had worked great for about 10 years. I had purchased a battery for it once. When it went dead this time I purchased this battery online. We put it in the phone for 24 hours like recommended to charge it before use and the handset got extremely hot. The battery looked like the one that was removed from the phone initially. I took the battery out and we'll purchase a new phone. I was disappointed that the battery didn't work.
__label__2 A+: As textbooks go, I found this one very readable - not as dense as most. It was a required text for my ed psych class. It's clear and easy to follow as an introduction to the different theories of developmental psychology.
__label__1 Junk: When I first purchased these they were lovely. But the longer I used them the moisture from the glass sitting on them starting to make the sand come loose and it was a mess. I ended up throwing them out.
__label__2 A surprisingly mature album: Ray Davies, who wrote and samg all the songs on this album, was still in his mid-twenties when this album was released, but it has the sound and feel of the music of one at least fifteen years older. In fact, it puts one in mind of some of the wistfully nostalgic albums Davies' contemporaries would make fifteen or twenty years later. But this Miniver Cheevy-like music is not only nostalgic, it's also really good. It stacks up well alongside the several great albums the Kinks made between 1966 and 1971. It's a pity that when the Kinks are mentioned, people can't seem to get by "You Really Got Me." There is so much more to the Kinks' work, and this album illustrates that beautifully.
__label__1 No instructions on how to use, does not cut tarp: I was disappointed with the lack of instructions that came with this set. It seems like the manufacturer assumes that you have used a kit like this before and you know what you are doing. It does not say which part is used for cutting a hole and which one is used for snapping the grommet pieces together. I did my best guess, but the cutting operation simply doesn't work, either due to dull edges on the sharp piece or, again, due to lack of instructions. A few pictures on step 1-2-3 and how you place the grommet against the tool would have been quite helpful. The prices is good, but I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__2 Best way to get rid of ear wax!!: I believe this ear wax product is the best on the market. You can not find a better product for a better price. I use it all the time, it is amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone with dirty ears.SincerelyDillon Formo
__label__1 ... to make a first impression: Well, they certainly picked the wrong story to use in the free Kindle trial version. Not only was the story they picked incomplete (cut off before it ended), it wasn't very good and didn't make me want to buy the whole book to find out what happens next.
__label__1 Ruined by Hollywood: I read the book "Captains Courageous" by Rudyard Kipling (great book, excellent message, very difficult language) with my children. Knowing they missed much of the story, we watched this movie to fill in the blanks for them.What a waste! We were disappointed in many ways. They changed the story terribly! In the book Harvey is not an orphan, his best friend doesn't die, and the captain is an excellent role model, not some ultra-distant and sometimes emotionally outraged man. It was horrible! We all agreed that the storyline was far better as originally written. It wasn't a case of a few minor details being changed, the entire virtue of the story was diminished. Why? Why? Why?Looks like there is a 1937 version we'll have to try. Back then I'm sure it was okay to teach life lessons about working hard, growing up, and appreciating family without needing to write them out of the storyline or making it really cheesy in the process.
__label__1 Thought it was awful: This is Bollywood at its worse. Fake emotions. Fake drama. Fake characters. Fashion is a terrible film. I'd only recommend it if your taste for Bollywood is towards something Karan Johar would make. If that's your taste then go for it. If not I'd say far away from this one.
__label__1 don't know: I'm very interested in reading I really don't know if I would purchase this book or any of them as this is the same review for all the herotica books( What's Up with that?)
__label__1 Wouldn't recommend: I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews from owners of dogs that suffer from chronic ear infections. My 2 year old English Bulldog has the same problem. The regular washes from the vet didn't seem to do much, so we tried this.Something in the ingredients really irritates my dog. For an hour or two after flushing his ears out, he shakes his head often. Not something he does with the regular rinses. Clearly it's irritating him, and after noticing the sticky texture on my fingers from the product, I can kind of see why.I don't know if this product does anything that other washes won't do, aside from annoy him. He is still having problems, so I wouldn't recommend using this stuff unless your vet tells you to.On the bright side, we do use the same brand of wipes for his wrinkles and they do a nice job of cleaning them out.
__label__2 So helpful!: I was so confused about what to do about feeding my 5 month old. Too early for solids? She seemed ready. Was I feeding her so much? She was getting so big so fast. This book made me calm down a great deal and listen to what my daughter was saying. We're both much happier now. I wish I'd had it from the beginning because it looks to have some great information on breastfeeding that would have really helped me out.
__label__1 Breastfeeding Moms Should Know: It alarmed me that this book puts the weaning information in the 6 to 12 months section. Doesn't the author know that the AAP recommends breastfeeding for at least a year, and that the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for two years,with no recommended weaning age? I wonder if the author simply ignored that information and included her own opinions about how long a child should nurse instead of actual facts.
__label__1 Only good for ultra-light duty: Form factor is very attractive and the phone and answering machine work well, but the fax machine is not good at all. Copies are quite weak, and faxing more than one page guarantees a misfeed. You really have to feed one page at a time to successfully send a multi-page fax.If you only fax once in a blue moon but want a home fax, consider this system. If your usage pattern is heavier, keep looking.
__label__2 Let's go to Nordland!: I am a new fan of Bathory. This was the first Bathory album that I purchased. I listened to the sound clips and they sounded pretty cool so I decided to get the CD. When I listened to the Cd for the first time I was just BLOWN AWAY! I have never heard anything with so much power and beauty as this CD other than the greatest band ever(DEATH). This CD is full of memorable guitar riffs and vocals. The whole album is perfect, every song is great. I recommend this album to anyone who listens to real metal.
__label__1 I can't believe I actually finished it: This book is hard to read, ridiculously overcomplicated, and even contradictory at times. There are several glaring mistakes in the editing. However, it does provide a somewhat biased, skewed to NCLB, view of "effective teaching methods" if you can interpret it. Not for the faint of heart. Best for those with a real need for an ABA perspective and significant knowledge of Special Education.
__label__1 Stinky Soap - NOT the Original Ivory: It's my own fault that I ended up with a two year supply of stinky soap that I could get at any local store. I read other reviews that claimed the soap they got was the original unscented Ivory. Maybe those folks did get the real thing, but that't not what I got. Why on earth did P&G ever do this to their old standard? I'm stuck with this garbage now, but when it's gone, I'll not buy another bar of Ivory until they once again offer unscented.
__label__1 not the original soap: This is not the original unscented ivory. They claim it is the original ivory soap, yet they replaced it with a scented soap. I will never buy from ivory again. I'm glad this happened because while researching I found out they test on animals and now I know I will never buy from them again.
__label__1 disappointingly reduced size artwork: I remember enjoying DNAgents when it was coming out as a(monthly?) comic. So, I thought I'd enjoy the compilation book.I was wrong.The book is a bit bigger than an ordinary paperback, reducingthe artwork significantly. Also, the color covers are lost.I'm a big fan of Mark Evanier's work ... but I can't recommendthis book. Check out "Fanboy" instead, or any of hisPOV books.
__label__2 Folk Knitting in Estonia: Nancy has done it again. Her book is a delight and a great "portable project" book. The illustrations, instructions, and patterns are very easy to follow and techniques are unique.
__label__2 Nine Dragons Hawaii Five-O The Collector's Edition: NINE DRAGONS HAWAII FIVE-O THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION was more than I expected, and I am proud to own my own copy.
__label__1 Yikes: Have never seen Bing and Bob doing slapstick comedy, but if that's your cup of tea ... this one's for you! A few great songs came out of this movie, but otherwise would rather have that 1-1/2 hours back.
__label__1 Don't Expect Research Assistance: This book is definitely not a research book. It is just a novel that uses the Hately family as the focus. Definitely not what I expected.
__label__2 Alexander Orlov - FBI's KGB General: Though a long read, I read this book while I was deployed to Iraq. I could not put this book down and read it in less than a week. General's Olov's experiences gave us a glimpse into Stalin's systematic killing of his top military brass. General Orlov's life on the run was fasinating to say the least. He was brillant in how he lived to stay on the run from the KGB. The fact that the CIA had no idea he was in the US until he came forward was something else. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the suspense kept me on the edge all the way to the end. Highly recommend it.
__label__2 She like it the theme of movie.: The movie is emotional. I like it very much. I see the movie with my daughter and we enjoy very much.
__label__1 Terrrrible: I had a feeling the movie would be weak but I tried it anyway. Saw the first 15 minutes. Then took it to the Used video store & sold it for Challege of the Lady Ninja ( which also is terrible). Avoid this movie at all cost.
__label__1 Dont Buy THIS!!!: Bought this from amazon because I needed a second controller to be signed in to xbox for testing reasons. I figured I'd go with the cheaper one since I didnt actually need it for gameplay. BIG MISTAKE!!! After 3 days of very little use.. It just wouldnt work at all. It wouldnt even light up in the center. Just died completely. AVOID THIS CONTROLLER!!
__label__2 Good Enough To Keep Me Playing: Don't have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's cheaper than the original ones, the material is expected to be cheap too, especially for the buttons. But if you're just going after something that will work and keep you playing then this should do. The wire is long enough but I use a USB extension cable to make it longer and reach as far as I want to.
__label__2 Perfect! Except...: I'll tell you, this controller works great for COD, TF2, Garry's Mod, both PC and XBOX gaming. But the only problem, with older games, the triggers register as the Z Axis, not buttons. Couldn't play GTA with it due to that.
__label__2 Good: Class required book. this book is really Good, but I find it difficult to undetstand a few problems in it.
__label__2 Open Ice - I couldn't put it down.: I gave Open Ice to my boyfriend (24) who does not read often for fun. He was reluctant to start the book, but as a hockey player, he was intrigued. He read it in 2 days and then told me to start right away so we could talk about it. I read it the next day and it was great! It was so cool to be able to talk about the book with him.I would recommend this book to anyone.After reading it, I e-mailed the author to express my delight with the book and she responded within 24 hours. I was so excited to actually communicate with an AUTHOR!Check this book out, even if you don't care about hockey, you'll get so involved with the characters and Nick's plight.
__label__1 Not compatable: Not clean print. smudges. doesn't get better after running for awhile. Don'tknow if this is a defective cartridge or just doesn't do the job
__label__1 not very user friendly: i actually returned this book as it was a difficult cookbook..im a pretty seasoned cook and did not find this to my liking.
__label__2 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOOK!!!: I was given this book as a gift for the holidays. I was immediately impressed with the photos, which made my mouth water. Chef Mantuano recipes make me want to eat at Spiaggia more often. This book will make a terrific gift or a perfect way to treat yourself if you enjoy food.
__label__2 Awesome Watch!: The Seiko SNP007 is well worth the money. Looks very sharp, and keeps excellent time. I have had mine for about a month, and am very satisfied with it!
__label__2 Well detailed: This what I would call a great "how to" guide." She really takes you step by step with materials and the actual process of creating the item. The only thing she doesn't address is when the fingers are too big to hold those tiny little parts. That may be more my issue than the author's. Wish more how to books were written like this one.
__label__1 Slow is correct if this is what they are selling: I agree with D. HenleyThis crock pot slow cooker is a crock!!!Wasted my money. I have not used it but maybe twice to keep things warm for a party. When I realy needed it to cook it didn't. Unless I had maybe two days to do it in. Which did not happen. I gave up on a pot roast I was doing. Turned off the power after 8 hours put it out in the frige and made something else for dinner.Got it back out the next day. Turned it on. Cooked maybe another 5 hours,still not done. Gave up and put every thing in my electric dutch over.Now we will get to have a nice tender pot roast. The slowwww cooker goes in storage for the next party I have. Just to keep things warm. Which I will start early and make sure I pre-heat.P.S. The little cooker is great. I think I should have just purchased that at a much more reasonable price.V. Morse
__label__2 good hold over till next release: mega, - this album basically is a mixtape. Mega is only on 2 joints solo, and 2 songs hes not even on at all. The production overall is strong, and mega smashes it lyrically. He seems like hes steppin up his game, and am lookin foward to see wat he does on urban legend. The album gets 4 and not 4.5 or 5, b/c the guests hinder some of the songs. Especially the one chick that sounds like a poor mans version of foxy brown or something, any song shes on, she basically ruins. The other guests more or less are solid. The best songs are Beatiful MInd, just mega, Tony/MOntana with ghostface, and Dangerous. If you are a Mega fan this is def one to get if you have all of his other stuff. If you are just looking to get into Mega, get the other 3 albums first. I just got Testament, and thats a straight classic. Overall this album is 4/5
__label__2 A lot of fun plus great messages: This book has many great messages - Let go and try to enjoy your kids a little, Motherhood doesn't always have to be so hard, and it's not a competition. While I disagreed with the author on some areas (like junk food and toy choices), there's a lot of enjoyment and confidence to be gained here.
__label__2 Love it: Great book! I think every Mom should read it! It makes you realize that you shouldn't take yourself too seriously and just have fun with your kiddos!
__label__1 Not Worth the Time: I felt I wasted my time watching this movie. I did not enjoy it and did not get the point of the plot. I cannot recommend it.
__label__1 Hartz tuff stuff not so tuff: I purchased the Hartz dog toy for my 4 month old puppy because it said on the packaging that is was tuffer than your average dog toy ...sick of buying cheaper toys that my puppy destroys , I purchsed it. Gave it to Lola, she loves it... one problem... she destroys it in less than 12 hours...half of that time she was sleeping. can't these companys make toys that don't get destroyed all over the house? at this rate I'm going to have to take out a 2nd mortgage on my house to keep my puppy happy and my furniture chew freeHartz Tuff Stuff Retriever (Colors Vary)
__label__2 Joyce Rupp does it again: The title and cover art alone are nearly worth the price of the book to me!Another excellent Joyce Rupp book.I read Rupp by myself but also as part of the reading for a spirituality group of which I am a part. I always leave her reading with new images and wisdom offering food for thought. I love her poetry, solid advice, and creativity.
__label__1 shoe size: I have no idea and how stupid are you to put the shoe size with the (3M,4M,9M...)what the hell is this? if i want to buy a shoe which size do I need to pick in order to fit my size?????Are you planning to sell those shoes for your people only? or trying to sell those shoes international??????I am living in USA,,,how the hell I know the 3M, 4M???????Check it out
__label__1 ugh....just shoot me: I liked Mr. Yates previous book and had high hopes for this one, but I struggled to finish it and after I did, I wanted to light this book on fire and throw it out the nearest window. Ugh, ultimately I just couldn't come to care about either of these 2 brothers who wallow in their misery. I just wanted to slap them and say get a grip or a least go to therapy. And then that ending was just dreadful. Hopefully this is all just fiction and none of it is loosely based on the authors life, because if it is, I truly pity him.
__label__2 My Personal Favorite: There are a lot of crappy lead free solders out there. This one is much better than most. It has a lower melting point that Cables To Go lead free solder, this makes it a good choice for SMD work. Used with flux it flows easily and predictably. Not sure if it's worth the money but if you are concerned about lead-free, and you're doing SMD work or just like solder that melts at a reasonable temp, this is a good choice. 5 stars for performance but knocked it down to 4 stars due to cost.
__label__1 Plain Disaster.: Scalded by an ex lover, Satchel sets out to set the score on all women. Bucky and Rob try and knock some sense into the injured pride of Satchel. "Not until I show them what I can do!", screams the depressed pooch. First it was one homeless girl. The next victim was a prostitute. The deaths keep mounting until the FBI finally catches up to Satchel and puts an end to his carnage.Based on The Son of Sam's serial killing spree, one would be rivited to this novel if for not the fact that we had seen the main characters in a different light before this. The Son Of Sam had been a mailman. Satchel has always hated postmen. This may be the reason that Conley has gone after the mail service. Could it be that Conley has an irrational hatred of the Postal Service? I for one enjoyed the original formula Cnley used in his books, that being the mundane life of Opus, Garfield and Jon.
__label__2 The Best House/Dance Comp I ever bought: I picked up this CD last week because of the strong and interesting track list, and was in for quite a surprise! Usually dance comp CDs are poorly mixed and use versions of the songs that I don't like. This CD was amazing. The first Disk has many familiar funky dance and club hits, and the second disk is a bit deeper without getting boring. The diamond in the rough, however is the immaculate mixing featured on the CD. I have never heard such an outstanding mix compilation. It moves well from track to track, and has some very unique and technically great mixes. I highly recommend this comp to any one who enjoys good house music!
__label__2 Better than OmniPagePro15: FineReader takes all of my scanned .pdf images and converts them into readable .pdf documents. It's somewhat less automated than Nuance's OmniPage, but at least I could get it to work out of the box, without contacting tech support (whereas I could never get OP15 to work, even after hours on TS).
__label__1 Junk: VERY hard to cut anything--VERY VERY DULL blades, didn't cut straight, very large/bulky....sent back to amazon for refund.
__label__1 How Much?: I bought this item for my wife for Christmas. I couldn't wait to give it to her. So the day it arrived I made her open it. The thing is huge!! Lucky for us we wanted salad so we read the instructions, and started to slice and dice. We hit the major salad stuff tomatos, celery, and cucumbers. The tomatoes were jucied kinda expected that. It worked good on the celery, and on the cucumbers it was very hard to slice. Some where during out first outting the main blade bent. I would expect that if we were chopping rocks, but rocks don't go good in salad. So save some money don't buy this one. This was our first mandoline, I think we'll stick the those wonderful Furi knives.
__label__1 Product design: This has a basic product design flaw- the handle for gripping the food is a defective design and does not work.
__label__2 introduction to the design of servomechanisms by Bower and Schultheiss: This was the first graduate text book i used in the early 1960s (i was majoring in automatical controls.) To the best of my knowledge from a collection of some 100+ volumes of text books written in this field, this book had the best treatment of the classical servomechnism designs (prior to the profliferation of Root-locus method and computer aided design tools) on BODE design technique. In particular, its chapters on Minor-loop design was the best. Its methodology can be easily understood and applied in the design dealing with systems with "not too trivial" nonlinearities. If I recall correctly, there is only one other book on the market dealing with this technique, though it was not as thoughrou as this volume. Moreover, this book included a large collection of practical servomechanisms design home works -- whioh gave me a lot of headaches at the time.
__label__1 Worse than useless.: I bought this for my Palm Lifedrive specifically for a trip to France. I wanted to be able to hear word pronunciations. The sound quality was the worst I ever heard from a computer generated voice system and completely unintelligible. Then to make matters worse PC Universe charged me a restocking fee for an item that did not work. Plus they did not process my refund until I called to inquire about it. This was my first and last purchase from PC Universe.
__label__1 Is that a lie?: Cakewalk"s advertisement saying something like..." no experience needed to operate this software..." is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most. I've had it now for about three weeks, work on it most days, usually in the middle of the night so I can really concentrate on it, and still cant get anything out of it.All I wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues, pop, country....so far nothing and I am thinking about giving up.I can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk I have ever seen.BEWARE...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed.
__label__2 The best album of its ilk!: As a former member of the band that recorded this album, I have to say that is just might be the album to change the way the world thinks about music. It's Rawsome!
__label__2 Have to admit I'm impressed.: Here's another battery-operated scrubber that I didn't hold out much hope for. But I have various jobs where I knew it could be useful if it had enough power, so I took a chance. And I'm heartily glad I did. I've used this for cleaning the hard-to-clean stuff out of casserole dishes -- the stuff the dishwasher only manages to bake in -- the chrome on my faucet, the sink basins, and my smooth-top range.This last job is really what makes me feel that the PKS150D has paid for itself. Anyone who has a smooth-top range will know of the dire warnings you get about what can and cannot be used to clean them. And so we're sometimes left with a stovetop which doesn't always look its best. But the non-stick disk on this scrubber does a fantastic job of cleaning off the hardest to clean spills without scratching the surface. Honestly, if you are tired of scrubbing your cooktop until you think your arm is going to fall off, give this little gem a try.
__label__2 Better: This Thomas Take-Along toy was a much better purchase than the last couple of toys from the same company. This toy seems to be better built, better thought out and a LOT more durable. Recently I was losing faith in the Learning Curve toys, but this is more sturdy like earlier efforts. I hope the company realized they were going too cheapy on last couple of Thomas toys. This one I would recommend.
__label__2 Erick Rubin Where Are YOU!....: I've had this CD for at least 2yrs now..and It Spanish/ROCK/POP..Ericks music not only cause its in Spanish is it Erotic/Sexy.... but His Voice! This is a must have ....My Favorite song it "TU"......
__label__1 Great, another "disorder": So my kid doesn't fit in. So he likes to fingerpaint off the paper. So he likes to hug people. I'm sorry this doesn't fit into the author's narrow view of normal, but that's just too bad. People come in all shapes an sizes. Just because my child is in one part of the spectrum instead of the other doesn't mean he has a disorder. "Experts" these days are way too eager to pigeonhole children as having something wrong with them when they are just normal active children.
__label__1 item never came, wasn't informed that it was out of stock: I was very displeased with the whole thing. It was for a Christmas present for my daughter. It would have been alright if it came late, but so much time had passed that I contacted the seller rather than the other way around. Even then they didn't reply to any of my attempts to contact them to find out what had happened. Finally I asked Amazon for help and got a refund, only then finding out the item was out of stock and no idea of when it would have been available. If you don't have an item to sell, don't say you do. It would save many dissapointments for the buyers.
__label__2 See it twice!: This book gives mainly painters' impressions of reflections in mirrors, waters and gleaming surfaces of all kinds, under different light circumstances and different angles. The text explains why our eyes see a reflection at the same time as they see a surface, and why the reflection tells what kind of surface there is. It also deals with the intriguing parts the mirror plays for model, painter, and spectator. This is really a very beautiful book and it is instructive for me, as a painter.This is a book to look into and to read again and again! Till now I borrowed it from the library, but I am happy to have it for myself now.
__label__2 Exactly what I was looking for: I bought these storage containers to set on shelving I installed for storage in a spare room. The bins were exactly as described and came in a package of 6 as ordered. You can see through the bins I'd describe them as frosted so there is still a bit of a buffer there. They are not as thick as I had hoped but for the price they've worked out just fine. Comparing prices I couldn't find anything even close that wasn't fabric or collapsable. I have everything from CD's to just miscellaneous storage in mine. Great value for the price and they are exactly what I was wanting.
__label__1 HP RIPOFF: Unfortunately, although I purchased this and other cartridges for my printer, unbeknownst to me, and no doubt others, there was a hidden expiration date encoded in the cartridge. Ergo, when I tried to use it I was obviously past that date and could not. Worse, my call to HP customer service resulted in a runaround suggesting my printer wasn't any good and offering me a "discount" if I purchased the latest and greatest. (No dice there!)Months later I learned of a class action lawsuit based on the above. HP, a generally honorable name should be ashamed of itself. Please note I had to give this a one-star rating as apparently blank, or negative, ratings cannot be shown!
__label__1 What is new? Where is the emphasis?: Here we go again. Another edition of the same book, without any significant additions or more emphasis. Yariv mostly puts together parts of what he had published decades ago in this book. He pays little attention to pedagogy and does not care to put connections between concepts in different chapters.I could not find a spirit in the book that ties concepts together. Yariv jumps from one notation or symbol set to another without giving you any notice, which makes me think that he was more concerned with putting together his notes in a book format than trying actually teach you the subject. Publishing essentially the same book as another edition just adds insult to the injury.Do yourself a favor and check out some other book on the same subject, such as Verdeyen's Laser Electronics. Or if you have to buy it, save yourself a buck or two and buy an older edition used.
__label__2 Recommended for environmental studies reading lists: The Chesapeake: An Environmental Biography by educator and political history expert John Wennersten is the informed story of the Chesapeake Bay (also called the Crown Jewel of Maryland) and the Mid-Atlantic region. From its ice age origins 20,000 years ago to how its modern-day health reflects directly on the health of waters all over the world, The Chesapeake: An Environmental Biography covers all that human science and history have known about this remarkable body of water. Strongly recommended for environmental studies reading lists and reference collections.
__label__1 Wolfgang has no tastebuds: Tastes like shiat. I bought it when it was cheap. I gave it a chance but threw out most of them.
__label__2 Handy MP3 Player: Plays MP3's to your car FM Radio. Sound is good quality, this depends also on your car FM radio. I listen to this every day on the way to work, and I have no trouble with the sound.I keep all the MP3's stored on my flash drive, then just plug into the Modulator. The handy thing is, that it remembers the last MP3 played, so it always restarts from the same track when the car starts. That's important, I used to have another modulator with out this feature, and it drove me nuts.I would recommend this, to anyone who wants to play MP3's in the car, but doesn't want the hassle of installing a fixed MP3 player.Remote control proved to be useful. I can always keep my eyes on the road. The only thing lacking, is an LCD display. But modulators with LCD displays cost about twice as much.Also, it doesn't overheat, and stays cool.
__label__1 A clunker: This device did not work properly from the get-go. It fails to hold a channel for more than a minute before the audio dissolves to noise. Sending it to the next station meets with the same result. It was a total waste of money.
__label__1 Great Device not very durable: This little baby did just what I needed it to. The sound isnt crystal clear perfect, but it plays as well as a radio station. The remote is GREAT! But, the construction was poor and it started coming apart when changing flash drives. It also had trouble maintaining the station. It became very frustrating. With better construction this would have been awesome (and likely would have cost more...so you get what you pay for). Good product for about 2 months. It plays better in some car stereos than others. Worth having, but only as a temporary fix. Don't plan on months and months of use.
__label__1 F-A-K-E: This product is not authentic. You can tell from the box in the picture. You shouldn't put MAC on products that are not actually from MAC. You probably bought this from some factory on eBay for like 4 bucks.
__label__2 Great camera for price, but not the best: This is a decent starter camera for the price-- the software is useful, and the pictures are crisp. However, this camera is relatively large and eats batteries (4 at a time), even with minimal LCD use. The lens cap keeps falling off and is not as convenient as a slide cover (like the Olympus Camedia D520, which I now use). I would recommend another camera like the Olympus or the Canon Digital Elph for the more active point-and-shoot person.
__label__1 Faulty CD: I teach a TASP remediation course, and in examining the CD that accompanies this book, I've found numerous questioning errors. Some of the questions do not correspond with the stories students are expected to read and comprehend.
__label__1 Terrible product: This pedometer doesn't work. It records steps randomly, usually not recording steps at all. I would not recommend this product.
__label__1 Missing steps: I bought this to measure my steps during the day - with the goal of walking 10,000 steps a day. But I don't think this pedometer is sensitive enough, because it's missing a LOT of my steps. I've tested it numerous times, counting my steps across the parking lot or around the house, and without exception the count is way off. Maybe it works OK for running, but for walking, I don't think it's sensitive enough to count accurately.
__label__1 pedometer: A piece of "you know what". It doesn't have a reset button, so the only way I could figure out to reset it everyday was to open the case on the back and take out the battery then put it back in, after a couple of days of doing this, the pedulum stopped working. So, buy a better model. I know I'm going to.
__label__2 Only the Brave: If you enjoy war shows or have family members who do this is one for the collection! I got this as a gift for my dad and he was thrilled.
__label__2 Wow, wow, wow!: Oh, man! I couldn't wait to read this book after hearing so many wonderful things about it from on-line readers' groups. Wow, am I ever tickled it was everthing people were raving about. A strong, modern day heroine. A hunky pirate hero who meets his match. I could practically smell the sea brine as I read this tale. Well worth the price! I'll definately read more by this author.
__label__2 Great cookbook!: Very simple, yet delicious recipes. Exactly what you would expect from Mr. Food. We're excited to make many of these dishes!
__label__2 Great origins story: This is how you make a cartoon. DC really needs to get that wonder woman movie moving again now. I can't fault this.
__label__2 5 stars all the way: I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. It is amazing! I have watched it several times already.
__label__1 Apparently in the minority: I was so excited to see that a WW movie was coming out as I am a big fan and I love Justice League. I was shocked an appalled over and over by how terribly they treated the characters in this. Steve Trevor was portrayed as a sexist pig-which WW ends up falling for? What a joke! The comments and adolescent behaviors continue through the entire movie! Even a comment about how much he likes her "rack"! He sees Amazons playing and splashing naked in a paddling pool--why are they not portrayed as doing something strong and athletic? Then, when they save the world, a presidential aid calls them a bunch of supermodels??I only gave it two stars for a couple of cool battle scenes and for the portrayal of Hippolyta, who truly is the example this WW should have been. Very disappointed, Hollywood!
__label__2 Neat little movie - not for children: Surprisingly good cast and script. Some great lines. Enjoyable to watch. Fighting scenes would not be appropriate for younger viewers.
__label__1 Disappointing: Packwood attempts to create a magical paradigm using memetics as his field of study but unfortunately he abuses the subject matter. Attempts to mystify and colour the system are lost in juvenile descriptions such as "Root Social Matrix" which he attempts to pass off as "substantial". Even more scary are his references to meme-atoms and meme-molecules. Memetics is a science; Packwood attempts to create a magical model using pseudo-science as his framework. He has possibly done more to damage magic's worth in the world of science than anyone else by writing such a poor book. Pseudoscientific claptrap made worse by the courier new font in large lettering for kids - except I wouldn't let my children read this rubbish! If you want to get into Magical Memetics, read the literature and make it up as you go along, you can only do better than Packwood.
__label__1 waste of money: This purchase was waste of money. File transfer to device directly (folder to folder) is almost impossible. Used Rhapsody or VMP to sync up MP3 files it only does for dozen MP3 and then crashed! It was much easier to drug and drop files to SD card outside of player, but when SD inserted to Sansa, the initiation process take a very long time and player cannot be used for 15-20 minutes. Battery life is very short. Wi-Fi is nice but it tied to Yahoo and that is dead already. I simply junked this device as it cannot be use for what I planned. Don't buy it!
__label__1 HP 38 ink cartridge: Beware-just opened this cartridge to install (was not needed until now) and discovered that it arrived more than two years past its expiration date. HP excludes all warranties and service if installed out of date. I have written back to the vendor, but past my return window (let's see what their response will be). Suggest opening package on arrival to confirm expiration dates, then resealing in plastic bag. This product was mis-represented by the vendor and deserves no stars.
__label__1 I was very dissapointed with this book!: I wish that I had not even bought this book! Probably half of the free things in this book were free catalogs, and lots of them were just free hotlines! I definitely advise you not to waste your money on this book, unless you would like to find out about a bunch of catalogs that you can get for free, shouldn't all catalogs be free! I was very dissapointed with this book!

__label__1 Didn't work as expected!: I bought this pedometer a month ago and now it's out of order. I used it 4 times in the past 30 days. First I thought the battery is dead so I bought a new battery to replace but still it didn't work..nothing appears on the display..it's still blank...It never fell down and was used properly according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
__label__2 The Forgotten War No Longer Forgotten: Mike Slater has absolutely brought alive the anguish and triumph of those men of the 5th Regimental Combat Team who held the hills of sacrifice in the earliest days of the Korean War and eventually finished their sacrifice along the Armistice line three years later. The depth of research is stunning, not in its presentation of cold facts, but in its blended and balanced perspective from the human and emotional side of the soldiers who fought in Korea. A rich collection of archived military photos as well as personnel photos from those who fought there will not disappoint those who enjoy a more visual depiction of the history they're reading about. An outstanding history that is captivating and remarkable. A must read!!!
__label__1 out of the frying pan, into the fire: This book is the story of a Roman Catholic priest who left his "church". Before becoming a Christian, I was in the "Church" of Rome too, for over twenty years, so I was very excited to read the author's motives.Unfortunately, the author left one cult to enter another. Instead of challenging the Catholic "church" for its many heresies and blatant idolatry, Davis criticizes the church's "outdated views" and unwillingness to accept destructive higher criticism, which is a heresy every bit as bad as Catholic doctrine.
__label__1 Not truly TEA glasses: I received these as a gift. In America a TEA glass is usually 12-16 oz glass, as I see now the product description does not say what size they are. so I was surprised to get a small 4 oz glass. They are pretty just not the size I was expecting.

__label__2 Cruising in the convertible, I heard....: I heard the most awesome Hawaiian, yet funky music that was great background music for where I was... in Maui! Those girls have great voices, and I have to say I actually heard this song "Promised love" about 4 times in one day, so I finally asked a man at a local market who was singing this song! I found out, and now have the cd! Maui NO KA OI!
__label__2 Robson Arms: With the Discovery of Corner Gas I was looking for something else new to try. This shows subject matter was a little harsh at first but I stuck with it and still interesting to watch. Not for kids at all though. The stories are very good and seem real. I have plans on buying Season Two.
__label__2 Good workout music: This CD is good for working out. I like all the songs and it is very easy to get into it. Some of the songs are unfamiliar, but with the upbeat music it doesn't matter.
__label__1 Great material; terrible binding: I am using this a text for an International Security class. It is a well constructed summary of the history of thought in this area. However, as I am reading, gently opening the book causes pages to just fall out without any sort of tension. They have clearly never been glued in in the first place.It's just a really disappointing purchase. If I could take time out of reading to return it I would.
__label__2 Great To Have: The solutions/study guide was a great help. I would definitely recommend picking up this supplement if you need to buy the accompanying text.
__label__2 Wonderful: McLeod's Daughters- truly Australia's most beloved drama- is a wonderful TV show, and it features heaps of wonderful, outback-styled music-- kind of like improved country-- capturing the true spirit of the show. Like the drama, its OST sings an anthem of love to nature and to the people who love it. Rebecca LaVelle, who does most of the music for the show and this OST, is a wonderful singer with a lot of soul, and this soundtrack features a variety of songs in different styles that are always fun to listen to. The theme will leave you skipping and smiling; Take The Rain Away, the background vocal for the show's greatest tragedy, will leave you sobbing; and Gentle Gentle, along with the DVD set you know you're just dying to get a hold of, will leave you dreaming of a life as a Jillaroo in some of the world's most beautiful wide open spaces. Buy it! You know you want to. You'll get hooked straight away.
__label__2 Love the music from this series: After finding and watching this series, I fell in love with the music. It is exactly from the series. The songs flow with the ups and downs of life. Love, heartache, loss, hardship and survival. I enjoyed it and I am definitely happy with the purchase. I might even look into purchasing some of the other music.
__label__2 gainsbourg: it's about a young boy who became infamous singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. when he was in his childhood in Nazi-occupied Paris,as he romances many of the era's beautiful women.
__label__2 Classroom Connections: Bernie is going to appear for a second time on my show Classroom Connections to discuss his wonderful book Love, Magic and Mudpies. This book is a must read for all parents, grandparents, caregivers, and teachers.With all the attention given to test scores, parents and teachers need to pause and remember that raising a loving and happy child to be a person of strong moral fiber, is a priority for parents and teachers.Watch Bernie's first appearance on Classroom Connections by going to YouTube and do a search for Classroom Connection or me, Jan Doyle.
__label__2 Perfect tool for home Bodyweight workouts: This item is worth its price and is a great home tool to do bodyweight workouts,great for dips,pull ups and atlas push ups also for leg raises.Easy to store and handy for people living in dorms or appartement!JDC
__label__1 Janky: I purchased this item direct from the Ultimate Body Press web site, and will be returning it. I was very disappointed with the janky quality...it should have been more like $50! The entire unit wiggles and seems of very poor design for the money it cost. There is about an inch of wiggle room when just applying pressure to one side with my finger....the whole thing just slants over. It is a simple design and I'm sure it could have been made a little more sturdy....it's just very cheap looking/feeling. I could build a stronger unit myself for 1/10 of the cost........and since this thing doesn't have any real advantages; like folding for storage, you might as well just construct your own unit and save a lot of money AND about 4 weeks of time (the time it took for me to receive mine after ordering it).
__label__1 Very close to buying one, but found much cheaper substitute: I was just about to purchase this, but I read a review that changed my mind.I got a walker instead. I am 6ft 165 and able to do at most 45 dips for a set(so far). This walker I recently got is perfect. They are built to support your weight. There was no assembly, and folds up better than this product.I was able to get mine for free as well through a local community center. Even Salvation Army has them for cheap. Amazon and eBay have them for less than half of this product's price.It is only for dips though, and not for any of the back exercises the video shows. Which is why I just bought a pull up bar from Wal-Mart for $19, so I can get some back exercises done at home now. I doubt that most of the people buying this product are doing so for the back exercises portion.Excellent for dips only.Recommend a walker without wheels.Here's a youtube video of a guy using one.
__label__2 Nice dip stand: This stand is just like what you see in the photos and video. I am very impressed with the quality. The tubing is thick enough that even if the padding on the handle sections were to wear out, the handles would still be comfortable. Assembling it was a piece of cake. The item was securely packed so that it survived the shipping process in perfect shape. When I perform dips with it, it is completely stable on my carpeted floor.Before acquiring this stand I was doing dips between two tables. This stand is a 100% improvement and much more comfortable on my wrists. I'm sure within a few months of regular use I will have a torso just like the model in the video ;)I'm very happy with this purchase.
__label__2 Three Mo' Tenors: Excellent . beautiful job - recording encompasses several different music styles and they're all done with quality. Have recommended this one to several friends.
__label__1 stinks, don't waste your money or your time if its free: I thought this book sounded like a good mystery type story with some added romance. Well, the mystery part wasn't bad based on where this man came from since he lost his memory and what happened to him. But, if you were hoping for some romance, forget it. This was the most disgusting book I've read. The author was so descriptive and coarse that she described the "enormous cock" right down to the shape and veins. There was constant crude language regarding the woman's "pussy" and more. I skipped over pages of crude, vulgar, and nothing more than porn in a book trying to just find out how the mystery played out. I'm glad I didn't pay 1 cent for this and am disgusted that I put any time into it. So, I rarely write reviews on books, but this one I felt was my duty to give a fair warning to those of you who like a little romance that this isn't it! The title makes it sound kind of innocent - lol!
__label__1 Lighthouse book: A lot of the information is outdated or just plain incorrect. There were lighthouses that were in the area that weren't in the book. Because it was outdated, some of the lights that were listed weren't visible due to tree coverage, etc. We did like having GPS coordinates, but sometimes they sent us further away from the light than what we could find on our own. It's a somewhat helpful guide, but use it cautiously and do your own research also.
__label__2 Excellent book: If you are an animal lover and/or have an interest in the struggles of vet school buy this book. It's a good read, lots of details, and has some good stories.
__label__1 It Was an R.L. Stine Flop: The Dare is a regular Fear Street horror book. Nothing different than any other. Nothing was unusual, weird, creepy, scarier than any other. It was boring and I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was surprising.
__label__1 Did RL stine write this?: Normally, I love fear street books, but this one was terrible! It was pointless, you couldn't relate to the character, it didn't make sense, and it was boring. There is no suspense in this book, and the main character is really weird. My advice: Don't buy it.
__label__2 Raw Revolution Hazelnut Cashew: Fabulous! I take one to work with me every day. I feel deprived without my daily bar!
__label__2 DELICIOUS!!!!!: I was more than surprised when I started to eat this meal bar. It is absolutely delicious! It is 280 calories, which I think is high, but it is worth it. Have this coconut and chocolate bar as a dessert you won't feel guilty eating.
__label__1 Another organic bar, but its HALF fat.: This bar has 265 calories and 135 from fat. I know, I know, its organic!! Sorry just because its organic and natural doesn't mean that it can be 50% fat and be good for you. If you like the taste fine, but be honest you're eating it for the taste, about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar.
__label__2 Unknown piano treasures by Adolf von Henselt: If he is known at all these days, Henselt is remembered for an Etude (0pus 2, No. 6 "Si oiseau j'etais") beloved of many great pianists in the earlier years of the 20th century and recorded by quite a few of them. Pianophiles will be familiar with his F Minor Piano Concerto, which has received several recordings, by pianists such as Raymond Lewenthal, Michael Ponti and Marc-André Hamelin.Now Hyperion has once again done us a great service by offering up this recording of two sets of Henselt Etudes, Opus 2 and Opus 5. Piers Lane gives extraordinarily beautiful performances of these difficult works. Henselt's piano writing could sound merely notey in less poetic hands, but Piers Lane brings out its dramatic beauties at every turn. The piano sound is, as usual with Hyperion, splendid.Altogether recommended!
__label__2 Perfect for Removing rust.: This product is perfect for removing rust off of any metal surface that might rust over. I would probably hold of on using this on something that you do not want to get dirty (perfectly polished pipes?). Although it removed rust, there are also tiny micro-particles in the fabric that causes micro scratches, but if removing rust is what you need, this is the product you need to have. I used this on an old motorcycle that was left outside for a few seasons and it cleaned all spots up nicely. NOTE: You do need to use some elbow grease if you want to remove some stubborn rust spots.
__label__2 Beautiful Ring!: I purchased this as a follow up to my engagement ring and it was a perfect match! The ring is gorgeous and made me very happy with my purchase.
__label__2 Meeting Mr. Right or Thanks, Mom: ROMANCE AROUND THE CORNER is a clever little book that was given to me as a Christmas gift--by my mother! She read it, enjoyed it, and recommended it so highly that I just had to read it also. WOW!!! The author, Valerie Beck, practically takes your hand and walks you through the steps toward meeting Mr. Right. Anyone can follow this creative plan, including me--an overworked, single physician.Simply by improving my wardrobe and smiling more, I have improved my outlook on life, thanks to Ms Beck. Plus, by following her plan, I am actually dating again! (Perhaps the reviewer "Sally" should do more than read the Table of Contents and eat fewer sour grapes to improve HER outlook.)In conclusion, I give "2 thumbs up" to this cute, pink book and have purchased several for my single girlfriends-just $12.95 for the paperback!
__label__1 Basically a rehash: I found very little new here that has not been written a dozen times beforehand. Although the title could lead a person to believe that this book is about the British and their strategy in the Revolutionary War down South, this is a bunch of battle histories strung together without a lot of analysis of strategy. John Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE is a bit better than this one, and mcuh cheaper!
__label__1 crappy poster wanna-be: this in not an original poster, it is a copy of one. you can see the fold marks in the picture.
__label__1 Cheaper Toshiba replacement: I bought this product several years ago to replace my wife's original cord for her laptop. The original AC adapter went bad after 3 years considering the abuse it went through in her last year of college. The original equipment from Toshiba cost over $80 at the time and this replacement seemed a viable option at the time of purchase. Sadly, this product did not last for more than 3 months. The outer insulation covering came separated from the housing and both sides and also at the outlet prong. I never returned the product because I needed this as a short-term fix at the time and have bought another laptop since then. The product served its purpose, but my recommendation is if you are planning to use this product do not use it where there is any stress put on the adapter. It will serve its purpose if you are the type of person who leaves your laptop set on you desk. Simply put, I got what I paid for at the time.
__label__2 Who ever said the media got things right?: Someone mentioned that the factbook lists a country as "Serbia and Montenegro" instead of as "Yugoslavia" as a big complaint about possible factual errors. Serbia existed long before the name "Yugoslavia" ever existed to be put on a map; and with the dissolution of Yugoslavia (for whatever reason one chooses to explain it), it has become Serbia once again, irregardless of what CNN uses on their news reports.If we substitute "Wales and Scotland" and "Great Britian" for "Serbia and Montenegro" and "Yugoslavia", those complaints sound rather silly.
__label__2 Quick Action on Missing Items: In the orginal Shipment, the Box arrived but had no silverware. As this was a gift for a wedding (2,000 miles away)which was set in the next few days. Your very fine phone help person was wonderful in getting the replacement silver to the wedding on time.As this was my first experance with your sight, I was at first conserned about getting it corrected. However she made it right and the gift got there in time for the wedding!Great Work!Bob FluckeySan Francisco
__label__2 Finally available: Nightmare Alley: Ideal film noir. Different and fascinating a trip through the midway of pyschic scams, sideshow geeks and a descent to hell due to ambition. Beautiful cinematography, extraordinary performances especially by Tyrone Power and Joan Blondell. Highly recommend to all film goers. It belows on the 100 great films.
__label__2 Shakespeare 4008 8' marine 1 1/2 Dia. Extension: Antenna arrived as promised and in great condition. Very happy with product and it's vendor. I have done business with them in the past and would reccommend them to anybody.
__label__2 Love or Loath Her you always find yourself listening: one thing about Madonna then as now She has never been lost with words on People,Places,&things.She has always had something to say on everything&everyone.I applaud Her for being Herself no matter what.interesting quotes through the years from her.
__label__1 Ho Hum: This is one of the few books that I have read that I can honestly say I did not like at all. The characters were uninteresting, and the story was slow and senseless. The plodding pace had me stopping frequently to try and remember what I had just read. Since I read this book in 1990, I have made a concerted effort to avoid Lewitt's books.
__label__2 Great book, very useful for teachers!: This is a very practical book full of history and information that is very helpful for classroom teaching. I teach 6th grade and found the diagrams and projects interesting and helpful in building an understanding of the sky.
__label__2 A lovely gardening read...: This book is so beautiful. After I received it I bought a copy for my best gardening buddy. I need to get one more for a couple who are apartment dwellers, but I found it very inspiring and useful and I garden on 3/4 of an acre. It's the best thing visually since "The Art of French Gardening". Thank you Rebecca Cole!
__label__1 bla: This product is suposed to be a very good tool , in theory but unfortunately in rel life is not , the tool will thread fine up to 1' but as soon as you go higher than that the bracket that holds the entire machine will break like a toothpick , and the reason is ,the bracket is made of cast iron and cannot hold the stress created by the machine , bottom line CHEAP, CHEAP. I did not know that and i got a second one and payed 200 more , and and up the same way , now i've got two machines witch are useless ( cant be used without the bracket ), and had to buy the rigid one ( another 600$). Now you do the math.
__label__1 sound quality very poor: there are some great songs here - "maintaining my cool" may be my favorite Sonics number, but the sound quality of this dvd is inferior to my old record with the same content. A real disappointment.
__label__2 Fantastic: I really enjoyed this book. I needed a little more closure, but it still gets 5 stars from me.
__label__2 another great: another awesome nickelodeon show. i love the adventures and all the animals that they encounter. such a fun show to watch.
__label__2 Jumanji - Hitting it!: Following Mateo is definitely a down to earth book. My friend Tom definitely put it right about life in the southern villages of Toledo and also as a missionary. I've known Tom for the two years that he spent here in Belize. I loved the book and will definitely read it again.
__label__2 Catch Up: Somehow I missed the Pixies. Maybe it was growing up in the Midwest in the 80s and being subject to classic rock stations galore. In any case, wondering who the band was that influenced so many 90s artists, I had to check them out. For my primer, I bought this greatest hits collection. Usually, it takes a few listens to find my favs in the album. Coming from the place of not knowing which songs were the "popular ones" is always a fun experience. However, I did begin to recognize songs I had heard over the years, either placed in movies/tv or casually on the radio - more so than I expected. Ones that stuck out for me were: Hey!, Gigantic, Gouge Away, Where Is My Mind. Love how this collection starts off with the total Garage Band sound and develops into the more polished (but not over-polished) production sound.
__label__2 And God looked down on the Pixies....: There has been a lot of excitement surrounding The Pixies. They are the most influential band of the 1980s. Black Francis invented the slow verse and fast chorus that paved the way for Kurt Cobain and PJ Harvey. Radiohead owe everything to them. They just finished playing Coachella to a packed house. I am glad that I wasn't there because it was mayhem. This is the first great collection of the best of four perfect albums. The Pixies (1987-1992) was this generation's Ulysses. All the hits are here. Hopefully this leads back to the albums. The Pixies deserve to be heard in their entirety. They created album rock and never had a dull moment. Even some of their later projects were great. Kim Deal's voice is great. Black Francis is a great songwriter. The guitar parts are so original. This is a great band. Hopefully more albums are released in the future. There are a lot of live shows out there.
__label__2 Bark Magazine: I absolutely love Bark Magazine! I love the "smiling" pages and the tips every issue. I am a dog lover and have rescued all of my dogs from either death row or from people who were going to put them down. Everyone deserves a chance at living and Bark reinforces that with their articles. This magazine is a MUST HAVE for any dog lover!!
__label__2 great listener!: This item can record as if it was right by the speaker, even though they'll be 15 feet away at least. It picks up everything that's around. I'm going back to collage. I don't think it'll miss any part of the lecture.
__label__1 Does not extent to 18': There is an error in description. Only extends to 6.5' . Good buy if that's okay.
__label__2 Good Flying Video: I am not one to listen to a guy stand on camera and talk about how great a place is. This video starts a little slow but gets going right away. They have a great deal of flying. Almost all the video is shot from the cockpit. Good thing in my view. The little talking they do is just to show what each spot has to offer and then back to the flying. I really enjoyed this video and it is good to see these places before you go into them. I understand it is not intended to be an instructional video but the quality and quantity of the content is very good.
__label__1 STEAMER: IT MIGHT BE A GOOD PRODUCT BUT I PURCHASED IT TO CLEAN MY GROUT,IT DOES BUT VERY SLOWLY AND WITH THE WATER NEEDED A SHORT WORKING TIME.A TOOTHBRUSH AND SOME HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WILL CLEAN BETTER FOR GROUT.
__label__1 Meh: Flaws:The little attachments are tiny scrub brushes. I tried to use them on grout. The grout shredded them.The "wait" light goes on every 60-90 seconds and you have to sit there and wait. This wouldn't be such a problem if I didn't have a 2 year old, but my time is in short supply.You have to wait for it to heat up before you use and and in between fill ups, you have to wait for it to cool down before you refill and wait for it to heat up again. This means about 30-40 minutes in between fill ups.So loud you need to use ear protection
__label__2 Wagner Steam Cleaner: Great buy. I have steam clean a TON of stuff since I got this. Works really great on the kitchen stove. Used it to clean a greasy, grimey landing that had dirt built up for 20 years. It's pretty amazing. Wish it had a few more attachments, but otherwise, very pleased
__label__2 GREAT STEAMER, Great price: I bought this steamer to clean our new NY apartment. So far I have cleaned all the grout and tiles in the bathroom, and it reaches that awful place behind the toilet :-) We also steam cleaned all the walls in preparation for a new paint job. This is a great steamer with good attachments! You can only steam for an hour at a time but in all honesty, your arms get tired after an hour anyway. I would highly recommend this product to all mom's who are looking for a safer way to clean without harsh chemicals.
__label__2 Cleaning with Steam: I recently purchased the Wagner 905 1,500 Watt Steam Cleaner. I could not be happier. Although I have owned a steam cleaner before -- a competitor's product and was fairly satisfied with its performance, there is no comparison between the Wagner and other products. I did a side-by-side comparison of several models that were similar to the Wagner and the Wagner came up higher in almost every category. The Wagner gets extremely hot very quickly, puts out a lot of steam so cleaning does not take as long, and cleans everything from crown molding to floors. I even used the corner brush to steam clean my furniture! Unbelievable how much difference this made to the appearance of the furniture. The Wagner is well priced and is a step above its competitors.Wagner 905 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner
__label__1 Did not perform well: I bought this product to primarily clean the grout in the bathroom. I was also hoping that it would work well for the kitchen floor. I was so disappointed. I had read the previous reviews and thought this sounded like it performed fairly well. Well it didn't. I sent it back. Not only was it loud - I was almost deaf after using it in the bathroom with the noise echoing off of all that tile - but it just didn't do much at all. Maybe it works good for other things?
__label__2 Superclean: I am in love with my new steamer!! The grout in my 50 year old bathroom looks brand new. Can highly recommend. FOr floor cleaning the attachments could be more sturdy but there is no arguing with the results.
__label__1 Not useful for older wallpaper: This product is not useful for removing older wallpaper. Can damage wall board underneath and is less effective than liquid wallpaper remover. Perhaps it would work well for the removal of more modern wallpapers, but if you have multiple layers of wallpaper in an older house I would recommend the liquid wallpaper remover instead.
__label__1 Power Steamer: In reviewing the comments on how much you can do with this product I must say I am a little disappointed. I thought I could use it to steam clean my outdoor BBQ grill. It did not do anything to the outside. I even sprayed it first with a cleaner. I also tried to clean the grills. I had to spray Oven Cleaner on the grill first & had to use one of the brushes to get it somewhat clean. I have no intention to remove wallpaper but did use it to clean the ceramic tile flooring in the kitchen. Decent job.Too much money for the job it did.
__label__2 Good Steam Cleaner: Purchased this product to clean original cermanic tile in my 55 year old home. I used it on the kitchen counter, floor and bathroom tile on the wall and counter. I am pleased with the performance of the machine. The little brushes included with the package work well on the grout. This machine gets surfaces clean and does not require chemicals to do it.
__label__2 An effective wet steamer: I bought this steamer on the recommendation of my pest control officer as we are currently dealing with bedbugs. I have used it to steam my furniture and carpet to kill the bugs and as far as I can tell it's been very effective. I can't comment, therefore, on the uses it's intended for, like wall paper stripping. It's very easy to use and has lots of useful attachments. My only gripe would be that it does spit water, but under most circumstances I'm sure that wouldn't affect what you're doing. All in all very pleased.
__label__1 not worth buying: I can make this very short the power steamer worked great untill all the plastic parts broke. When the handle broke it was the end of the line the unit was set out for the garbage.
__label__1 Not very impressed: There was nothing special about this machine. I can do the same amount of work as this machine does with a rag and soapy water. It isn't totally useless I suppose...but not worth spending the money. I was expecting something great.
__label__2 Cyberchase shows: In the past I have not missed a single Cyberchase show, now it's going to be a book!!! I'm really excited.
__label__1 integrity, honesty: I received the game in a short amount of time, the game does not work in my new console..I wrote the company I purchased it from, they were very understanding, returned my payment and told me to keep the game and try in someone else's console..I will purchase from them again, as they did not even question my integrity, nor my honesty which makes them top in my world.
__label__1 Legal Action for a defective product?: Hello, I've had the same problem with this tv. The blue blotches and the yellow discoloration. My warranty did expire though Zenith did say they would cover the 2500 dollar part. That's nice and all, but I assume they are using the same parts that these tvs were initially built with. I expect it will work for about another year or so until I'm faced with having to shell out all that money to have it fixed again. I'm wondering if any legal action can be taken against Zenith/LG for manufacturing and selling a defective product? Perhaps it falls under some kind of product liability law? I Just want my money back and I'll be satisfied!!!
__label__1 Very Interesting Person/Very Amateur Documentary: This doc only whetted my appetite to learn more about the life of Chrysis. It teased me and then did not get the job done! What a loss. Maybe someone else will make a decent documentary about Chrysis.
__label__1 A BIG MISTAKE: WHAT A MISTAKE BUYING THIS SAW I DID NOT BUY IT FOR EVERYDAY USE ONLY CAUSUAL VERY VERY HARD TO START EVEN AFTER RETURNING IT FOR REPAIR THE FRAME BROKE ON THE BOTTOM ALSO LEAKS OIL A REAL JUNKER ***** DO NOT BUY THIS SAW
__label__1 MBT: My first B9180 lasted about two weeks before sending a message saying "Service Stall". It never recovered and was replaced under warranty. My second B9180 lasted almost a month before sending the same message. It too was replaced under warranty. My 3rd B9180 lasted one year and 5 days. It then began spitting yellow ink all over photos and the inside of the printer. It was out of warranty and will cost me about $300 for an exchange through HP.When the printer actually works, it does a great job on prints ranging in size from 4 x 6 to 13 x 19. But I've got to think that my run of bad luck with these printers is more than just coincidence. I'd look elsewhere for a photo printer.
__label__1 Just Stopped Working after One Month of Light Use: I've owned this printer for less than two months. Just last week, it stopped working. After a few minutes with tech support, I was told I have "defective firmware" and that I can exchange it for a new one. Here's what it does: When I print something, it stops in the middle of the first piece of paper, and tells me I'm out of paper. Nothing prints, I'm actually not out of paper, the thing is just totally screwed up. Another thing, when I first bought it and set it up, before I had a chance to print one thing on it, it ran out of black matte ink. It wouldn't let me set it up on the network cause it wouldn't let me past the "out of black matte ink" message on the screen. My local stores do not carry this kind of speciality ink, so I had to wait until my ink arrived in the mail and the network person had to come back to my house to finish setting up the network.
__label__1 Dissatisfied: Owning and using this printer has been a very frustrating experience. I've been using hp inks and paper, and printing from Adobe photoshop and Lightroom, and no matter what I do the prints look muddy. This printer is an energy hog - you have to leave it on all the time because if you turn it off it demands 3 full size sheets of glossy paper so that it can realign its printheads - wasting ink and paper! Lately I have been using it to print a logo and return address on stacks of postcards from Mircosoft Publisher, and it keeps telling me I have the wrong size paper (even when I *just* set the printing preferences). It also keeps telling me the carriage is jammed but most of the time the carriage will move just fine if I press the OK button - except that it spits out a half-printed card. What a waste!! It was expensive, takes up a lot of space, and not once has it turned out anything I've been really happy with. I would give it zero stars if I could.
__label__1 Don't buy this printer!: My B9180 worked properly for a total of about one month before developing major problems, which frustratingly come and go without reason. These problems have included banding, extreme color errors, paper loading errors, stalling. Even when working this printer is painfully slow as it always seems to hold you up with some kind of 'routine maintenance' like head cleaning that make you wait 10 minutes before you can print - making it unsuitable for anybody with deadlines.Bottom line: this printer has good specs and looks great on paper, but doesn't back that up with any acceptable amount of quality or durability.
__label__1 DONT BUY THIS!!!: The worst printer I've every had, by far. Painfully slow. Jams constantly. Very noisy. Every time you bring your PC out of sleep mode, it pops up an annoying Status window indicating the printer is online, also pops this up randomly at times. I will go back to Epson next time.
__label__1 Appalling wheel marks on glossy paper... not a pro machine.: HP must be some very powerful company. I've read lots of positive reviews on this printer, so i went a purchased one.But i quickly found out that it marks lines on glossy paper (both HP and Tetenal)This is unacceptable for a pro range model. IF you don't use the printer daily, the ink cartridges will be emptied via some "servicing", ie., to keep the jets unplugged, the machine keeps gushing the ink out every so often... you return home after a few days to find your cartridges near empty.Then after a year, i keep having to reset, restart, keep finger crossed etc...A nightmare !!I do not recommend HP B9180, and i won't buy HP again, ever again !
__label__2 very well made bag. But it's too big.: I bought this bag for a Gitzo 3541 tripod. Although not the largest of tripods, it is of moderate size. The only thing larger in Gitzo are Series four or five tripods, which have a wider top portion. Even under those circumstances, I find the space a bit too generous. Extra space means extra bulk when carrying and the internal slop negates some of the protection that is afforded by the bag. I'm in the process of ordering something that fits my tripod better. I'm going to use this case for compact light-stands, which it seems well suited for. I can fit three Cowboy studio light-stands that fold up on themselves, quite easily. Like I said, it's a well-made case, just not for most tripods. And for the minority of people out there that carry series four or five tripods (or equivalent), I would assume, they have the budget to spend on something more tailor made.
__label__1 Problems: I agree with Peter Williams. It was great to finally see some episodes of this long-forgotten series come out on DVD. BUT...the quality is apalling!! Discs 2 and 3 are full of pixelation problems...and the episode THE BLOWUP (on disc 2) jams...then jumps 6 minutes ahead. The result...a 48 minute episode plays for about 42 minutes...missing a few vital scenes in the middle of the episode. More care in mastering (or manufacturing) is required from Timeless Media before I'll be buying any more of their DVDs.
__label__2 Love it!: Clear, crisp images, used in bright sunlight it makes the color saturation and contrast so much more visible. Can't live without this one in sunny Florida, especially when waterside compositions are being photographed. Reduces glare, restores back lighting to a natural color.
__label__1 rather poor quality: It worked well for about 6 months until the top element died. Light use-a slice of toast maybe twice a day, and an occasional melted sandwich.definitely not worth the price.
__label__1 Disappointed: The Rotisserie was nice, made some nice juicy chicken.I enjoyed this product for the few months it actually worked.Their customer service department is simply a JOKE. Rude and helpless a total waste of my and their time...would NOT buy this brand again.
__label__1 finally trashed: this dvd player is the worst. I bought it at a bargain price, but what a mistake!the dvd drawer opens REALLY slow!some DVD's don't work, althought hey work just fine with my other DVD player.it takes a long time for the dvd player to actually start playing the disc.I'll give it 2 stars because it was cheap and it's nice to look at. I gave it to my friend and he already gave it to charity.a real P.O.S.I'm happy with my new Sony 1 disc player. it's fast and plays all of my dvd's.
__label__1 The toy broke within a few weeks: The toy did seem pretty neat - until it broke a couple of weeks later :-(..No sounds anymore..Also the on/off switch was impossible for my 1 year old to find (frankly it was hard for me too - it's very hidden)/.
__label__1 Obvious Bias, Lack of Qualification: There are numerous reports that can debunk most, if not all, of the ideas presented in this book. A far better (free) report on this type of thing is "The Lanning Report", by Kenneth Lanning, an FBI Agent who used to work specifically with ritual abuse cases. Google for it & check it out; I promise you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on this piece of junk.
__label__1 author has an agenda: some of the research is credible, but the conclusions in most cases don't follow the research. for example, the state department is consistenly blamed for actions undertaken by the defense department. why? also, many of america's arrangements with other governments are not examined in the context of the cost-benefit analysis as a whole; they are only presented in isolation which would make many arrangements puzzling and suspicious. given that, the question here is why did the author selectively choose which foreign countries to isolate?ultimately, the real question raised by this book is what were the author's motivations in praising the defense department and attacking the state department?if the reader is looking for a more insightful and balanced view of the relationship between the 2 organizations, i would recommend "Kissinger" by walter isaacson.
__label__1 Not really a book, not really about Cap Anson: Cap Anson 2 is actually about another 19th century baseball star, Mike "King" Kelly ! It has no narrative flow at all, it's just a massive collection of newspaper snippets about Mike Kelly. For a real book about the great, flamboyant player, I suggest you read the original bio of Kelly, from Scarecrow Press' Sports History series. It's by Marty Appel, a real author.
__label__1 Boo: After a few months of having the TV we noticed dark gray spots when it was a dark part. Luckily it was still under warrenty and Zenith came out and fixed it right away. Then just recently we got a blue spot in the bottom corner that grew across the bottom. We're still able to watch tv (for now) but not for long it sounds like. We got online and looked up the issue only to find out this is almost a guarenteed problem with this model of Zenith and cost more to fix than buying a new TV. We seem to be lucky having it last ALMOST 4 years, some people's didn't even last 2.
__label__1 Repaired Twice!!!!: Mine did the same as all of the others, blue screen the works, less then a year after purchase. Under warranty the entire contents of the light engine have to be replaced. Now a year and a half later the exact same issue. I did purchase extended warranty so I didn't have to pay for the repair. So, here is the deal guys. If you buy this TV which by the way when working properly does have a nice picture better buy it form some place that offers an extended warranty like for 4 yrs and that includes a lemon policy. That way you end up with a new TV after they have fixed it 3 times....BECAUSE they will. I want a different too what a piece of junk. The thing is it was just released before the technology was ready. So lets admit it and make it right!!! I'll at least respect you that way.
__label__1 Class Action Suit?: My boyfriend bought this TV the first year it came out--he paid almost $6,000 for it!!! It's now almost four years old. We've have the same green/yellow tinge with loads of blue throughout. Quoted over $1,000 for the repair. The local repair people didn't even have to come look at it to know what the diagnosis was. This product is a lemon and the manufacturer keeps rolling out the product year after year. The manufacturers are criminals. If I had the money and time, I'd sue them.
__label__2 Worked Great!: Great Product! the quality is great nice Glass construction. Will buy more products from them in the future.
__label__2 Early 70s pop that has aged remarkably well: I recently picked this up on a whim. I'm 49 years old and had never purchased a Carpenters record. I saw it at a used record store and thought, "Isn't it about time?" Now, I've always had mixed feelings about the Carpenters, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it all the way through this. Well, not only did I listen to it straight through, I left it in the CD player for several days and several more listens. Yes, the songs tend to be saccharine, and the production is technically flawless to the point of sterility, but it's never corny. It is what it is, and it's totally sincere. The instrumental performances, largely multi-tracked by Karen and Richard, are breathtaking, and Karen was simply one of the greatest singers of all time. Isn't it about time you gave the Carpenters another listen?
__label__2 The Secret Knowledge of Grown-Ups: Do you know why squash is named "squash"? Why you shouldn't jump on the bed? Why you should eat your vegetables? This book offers a humorous look at the answers to these questions.In this nonsensical look at these answers, parents and children alike will laugh and enjoy it over and over again. Illustrations capture attention in a comical manner. The print is large and easy to read. As teachers, we recommend this to all ages--and teachers, too, who could use this as a springboard to creative writing.
__label__2 Creative Writing Exemplified: This is a very funny book. I use it in my classroom of middle schoolers.As an English teacher, I use this book in my classroom to illstrate "creative thinking". We had so much fun writing similar rules.
__label__1 BORING-BORING-BORING: I HAD EXPECTED MORE ABOUT SPIRITUALITIY FROM THIS WORK BUT WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED TO READ MORE FAR OUT VIEWS ON THE AUTHORS OPINIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD. I FELT ALOT OF ANGAR EMINATING FROM THIS WORK. COULD SOMEONE WHO SEEMS SO ANGRY REALLY BELIEVE IN THE LAW OF ONE? THIS BOOK CONTAINS MORE FICTION THAN SPIRITUALLITY AND I COULD NOT RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
__label__1 Awkward fit: This review is for product & seller.I did not like this product. It's bulky & extremely uncomfortable. I'm surprised people can sleep in it. I'm petite so ordered an XS. It was too big. It offered no support to upper back and did not help posture.As for the seller. BUYER BEWARE! I suggest you shop around. I feel ripped off. I never used the product & not only did i have to pay return shipping, buy they charged a 20% restocking fee. I ended up paying $17 out of pocket just for trying the stupid thing on. Not worth it!
__label__1 Same reviews for all sellers: It does not give me confidence buying from Amazon when the same reviews for a product are applied to all the sellers of the product. I cannot get specific information on the sellers' products to see if they are genuine original products, or "equivalent" products, whether of good or poor quality. Because there is no differentiation between the sellers and their products; and I am unable to make a fair comparison from the information provided or other peoples' experiences; I must purchase elsewhere.
__label__1 It's Not Multicoated. Leaves a funny flare when taking pictures of light.: It works as a polarizer no doubt. Fits right on my 50mm lens.But it creates a wierd greenish flare when I am taking pictures of any light source (e.g. lamps, sunlight).But sometimes flares are cool. I would recommend spending more money on a multicoated circular polarizer, or not buying any at all.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: Same experience as Mr. Kupo.It needs to be completely quiet in the room for this thing to work at all. Even then, it often displays the wrong note, and for the E string it displays it for such a short time I can't even tell if it's tuned properly.Overall, I have a tuner app on my iPhone that I went back to using because this thing is so frustrating to use. Either buy something better or save your money for something else-it's not worth having around.
__label__1 Baby I Love You Solution: You can get the unedited "Baby I Love You" at iTunes.Yes, yes, they're the devil, but at least you can get the song the way the Yayhoos performed it, instead of this Wal-Mart version.
__label__2 The Restless Gun: We purchased The Restless Gun on 6/7/12, three DVD set with 24 episodes. We have until now completed the first disc and part way through the second, we have enjoyed each episode so far with very good storyline, acting with John Payne playing his role so well, and no doubt the quality of the picture and sound, no surprise there as this is what we receive each time with Amazon and Timeless Media Group. For those that like Westerns this is a good quality product.
__label__1 Confusing: I cannot understand how anyone could give this book even a 2 star rating let alone a five star rating. Every third word of the text was an acronym and in at least one case an acronym appeard before it was defined. I was thoroughly confused from the git go. Furthermore if you are interested in finding out how HDTV works, you won't find any information on that in this book. I gave up after two chapters and returned it to the library.
__label__2 Psychoanalyzing Your Favorite Producers Through PIctures: I've never spent so much time analyzing a photo book. Each picture occupies me with about five minutes of psychoanalysis, trying to figure out the motives behind each piece of gear or memorabilia in the pictures. Each studio also confirms my hypothesis: the cleaner the home studio environment/setup, the less that actually gets done.
__label__1 Saw Palmetto-miracle cure?: The Vitamin Shoppe got this product to my house quickly, but it did not work. I had studied that saw palmetto was good for hair loss,but all it gave me was a headache. I saw NO improvement in hair growth. I studied that it was good for prostate health and libido. Basically, it just made me have to urinate ALOT and reaked havoc on my kidneys. I will NEVER get this product again.
__label__1 great til it explodes in your hand: I had one of these for about a year and it worked great, then one day I used them on a stubborn caliper. Now look I'm no super human or anything but I went to squezzing this tool and the ratcheting mechanism completely failed in mid squeeze. It made a loud pop and my hand was numb for a week. so I'll say don't attempt to use this on anything that is going to resist your effort, but then if you did that, a pair of channel locks and an old brake pad would work fine. I recommendSir Tools (SIRST9020-KIT) AIR-GUN Pneumatic Brake Caliper Piston Compressor Master Kita pnuematic compressor if you must have one. perhaps,you want this one for actuated calipers anyway. if you don't want to get this extravagant maybe a pair of the scissor style spreaders.
__label__1 A Mindless Boring Button-Mashing Game with Heroes in It: I finished the game and had to write a review on this game because it was so bad. The game is basically a button-mashing game with no excitement. I found myself trudging through the game just so that I could finish it. Otherwise I would have spent a lot of money for nothing. If you are a novice gamer, you will get bored with this game. If you are a veteran gamer, you will stop playing in ten minutes. Don't waste your money on this game. It felt like a game the company rushed to put out in order to cash in on the super hero craze and/or holiday spending. There are many games out there that are super hero games out there that are a whole lot better like X-Men Legends I and II. They even came out way before this dud.
__label__1 Ambitious but dull: Robinson's story is very ambitious and brims with a ton of detail. However, it's incredibly dull. These are a series of linked stories, each involving new characters (despite the thread of reincarnation ostensibly tying each story together). None of the individual stories is compelling--the characters are mostly bland, nothing in their lives is particularly at stake, and the alternative history aspect is an very minor component. I loved Robinson's Mars trilogy, but was incredibly disappointed in this book.
__label__1 Ponderous, dull, self-absorbed, metaphysical BS.: It took months to slog through this yawner because I alternately fell asleep or found somthing far more interesting to read, which wasn't a difficult task.
__label__1 This book defeated me: I threw this book in the trash the other day unfinished. I never do that but this book just defeated me.I loved Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series and had high expectations for this book, even knowing going in that it was different in many ways.The alternative history and reincarnation aspects were sort of intriguing at first but the many stories contained in the book (due to the periodic "reset" of reincarnation) are boring and hard to follow. There is just too much text dedicated to mundane activities and no real plot to latch on to.The book put me to sleep more times than I can count to the point I just had to give up.
__label__2 Love Letters is simple, yet heartbreaking: Love Letters has a very simple concept: Two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. They never look at each other. But within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the play will carry you away with delight. I read this play as I was browsing through a bookstore. I just wanted to read the first couple of pages since I'd heard so much about it. After page three, I didn't want to put it down. Now I'm buying it for a friend. Don't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. If you have ever been in love, you WILL recognize parts of yourself in this. It always stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful.
__label__2 As an actress in this show...: I am involved in a production of this play right now, and I have to say that when I read it before I auditioned, i cried, and the same was true in both call backs and the read through. This is a moving piece that proves that two people do not have to be married to be truly in love and live for each other. This play helped me inspect my own life and treat those around me with more thought as to the rest of our lives together. An excellent read, for the layman and the professional...
__label__1 Worse than Worthless: Don't bother getting this book. It's a load of junk. Worse than a load of junk. The advice given is bad advice and if you follow it, you will end up at best being laughed at, at worse owing the IRS MORE money in penalties and interest than when you started. You could lose your car, you could lose your house.People have already tried using the ideas in this book and they have lost in court.The statements about who is an employee and who owes taxes are dead wrong and if you follow them, you will end up owing everything you owed before plus more in penalties and interest.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK !If you need a book to help you deal with the IRS. There are far better books put out by Nolo Press including:Stand Up to the IRS,Surviving an IRS Tax AuditFight the IRS in Tax CourtandTax Savvy for Small Businesses (which helps you avoid ever needing the other three).Any of those books would be far more helpful than "Cracking the Code"
__label__2 First book of a promising series: Grace, Hannah, and Amelia are senior citizens who are living in a joyless boarding home, thanks either to their circumstances or to their children.When Amelia inherits a home in the mountains of North Carolina, the ladies decide to investigate the house and see if it has possibilities. They overcome their fears and doubts and even the ramshackle state of the house in order to renovate and renew their lives and create a new home together. They soon fall in love with Covington and become involved with new interests and new friends. Their first year in Covington is an eventful one, as they forge their new lives and gain confidence and independence. Not all of their problems are solved, which leaves plenty for the succeeding books in the series. I look forward to reading more about the Ladies of Covington.
__label__1 Another "waste your money on" toy from Mattel: I recently purchased the Hot Wheels Tech Trax Crash Chamber for my Grandsons birthday. It took hours to put it together, had to be "just so" or it wouldn't carry the car. NONE of the other Hot Wheels cars my Grandson has (about 50) would work on the track. The car that was sent fell apart and you have to order MORE to use the track at all. My Grandson got no use out of this set and was very frustrated. It was very disappointing. It's no wonder the price was so reduced. I won't be buying any more Hot Wheels cars or accessories from Mattel. Too bad, you used to be a good company.
__label__2 A simple, well thought-out, introduction to lace knitting.: Before getting this book, my knitting had been limited to Arans and Guernseys.This book is a great introduction to designing and creating your own lace creations. Starting with triangles, the author step-by-step explains the different shapes in which shawls traditionally are knit. While there are 8 patterns for shawls in the back of the book, I think the author's point in writing this is to get your own creative juices flowing. She shows you that it is possible to be a designer.For me, the charts of different lace stitch patterns are more of help than hindrance, as the review below suggests. By using the charts and some graph paper, the designer can "see" what the design is going to look like before it is even knitted.Overall this is a great book!
__label__2 a very good book for sql7 beginner: I've used Access 97 for 2 years now and I want to upsize to SQL7. This book offers me the basic overview nearly all aspects of the product.
__label__1 Bad Exerience: The TV which was received was not the one pictured in the Amazon ad nordescribed in the description. The TV received had speakers underneath and not on the sides. The ad noted that the TV had frame by frame capability which the one received did not. Discount Jungle offered a $20 refund or to take it back at my expense (over $50) I seem to be stuck with it.
__label__2 The best guide for single women everywhere: As a single, black female in my late 20s, I have continually focused on finding someone to have as my own. This book made me realize that person is me. I am SO incredibly happy being single the book made me realize I can have a fulfilling life into my 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond without being tied down to someone. The alternative to being single is not bliss (I've seen way to many messed up relationships to believe that's true). Being single is a blesing and not a curse.I've read a lot of "you go girl" & "loving the solo life" kind of books, but this one offers practical advice and really struck a cord like others haven't.
__label__1 Quality control issue: It ran too fast, it gained 7-8 minutes per hour! Unacceptable. I had a Tissot Seastar Automatic and it only gained a minute in 5 days. Was not expecting this from Seiko. I really liked the simple construction and design, I could have it's time adjusted in a jewelry store but wouldn't want to pay more when it should be working properly in first place. Not worth the time. I have to return in.
__label__1 WRONG Keyboard: 1) The "64350" keyboard is for MAC computers only, not PC's!2) The product photo (white keyboard) that you see here on Amazon is NOT the keyboard that you will receive. The white keyboard photo is for the 64330 keyboard, not the 64350 keyboard. For a detailed description of the "64350" keyboard that you will receive, go [online.]P>3) After promising a full refund (including shipping), and after returning the keyboard, Office Depot did not even refund the full amount of the keyboard plus taxes! After calling up and complaining, they again said they would offer a full refund.4) Over a week has gone by and Office Depot has not corrected the incorrect keyboard image on this web page.
__label__2 Blue Murder 1: I first watch Caroline Quentin in Jonathan Creek. Blue Murder is compelling, sometimes intense, but has a mixture of humor, family life. A great series. C.W.
__label__1 Horrible Instructions - Didn't Work After Many Attempts: I bought this so I could enjoy my new Sony 36" HDTV at night without waking the baby. First, the instructions simply say "make necessary connections" and nothing more! My TV was set up by the delivery technicians, but I still am pretty knowledgeable about such things. There was no available "Audio Out" on my set, so I tried everything that was open on the back of my receiver. Nothing worked. Never did get sound. I am returning this product ASAP! Who needs the aggravation!??!? Maybe I'll try a Sony model.
__label__1 I hate to tell you but these [###].: Finding the exact right frequency for the headphones is a never ending task. I bought the cheapest and upgraded until I got to the most expensive wireless headphones from Sennheiser. The bass doesn't come through and they just aren't acceptable. I returned them all one by one and got the Sony ones. Great bass and good reception. Sony only has 2 chanels though so if a lot of people have them, it becomes tougher not to interfere.
__label__2 Gorgeous: Although the islands are ignored, the crisp photography, narrator with a pleasant burr and fine music make this an exceptional entry in the "Visions of" collection. Almost equal to "Over Ireland," still the best of the fly-by films.
__label__1 Not As Good As I Had Hoped: Although stunningly beautiful in a number of places, the videographer spent an odd extra amount of time filming bizarre things like a ship passing under a bridge, the same ship passing under other bridges, and the same ship passing under by under the helicopter. Was the "The Ship" video? In other areas, the videographer seems to delight in filming their landing and airport flyovers. Not exactly what I wanted to see in a video about Scotland. Numerous clips were used repeatedly (yeah, saw that, yep saw that already... etc) and instead of filming the countryside or town, the videographer focuses on one specific spot in a town (a tall castle, or one hill peak) so you don't get the see the rest of the town or hillside. Narration, when it exists at all, seems to be a complete after thought and is incomplete, boring, and tedious. This is not what I would call a quality product and given the price, it's a definite NOT RECOMMENDED review from me.
__label__2 Visually spectacular, but ....: Although I liked the video there are a few locations that the narration never identifies, and there are many well known islands that we never are shown. I am puzzled why Islay, Skye, Harris, etc. are never shown, especially considering how much time is spent on the major cities. Perhaps the video should have been longer, or multi-episode?
__label__1 J.D. Robb is great--The others aren't worth the time.: If you are a fan of the J. D. Robb "In Death" series with Eve Dallas as the main character, then you will probably want to get this book just to read the short story featuring Eve Dallas by J.D. Robb. The other three stories will probably be an ever-increasing disappointment to you. The final story in this book was about a menage a trois and ended with absolutely no resolution of any of the plot points whatsoever. I rate it a complete waste of time and money. But I love Eve Dallas' character so I would have bought the book if only for her story.
__label__2 So much fun!: I played this recently (with a group of 30 somethings) and it is HYSTERICAL. So much fun, but half the fun is watching people play and their reactions when they get "shocked." A great game to bring out in a crowd - adults or kids. Someone in my group got it as a white elephant gift, and I liked it so much I had to search for it here. A must at a good party.
__label__2 Wonderful Step-by-Step photo directions: Along with the great gardening plans and in depth directory of vegetables giving soil requirements, sowing, harvesting, storage, pests, diseases and varieties best suited for your location, each vegetable has 5 or 6 pictures. The recipes are divided by season and the photos were very easy to follow in order to create very fancy dishes in a very simple manner. The fillets of sea bream in filo pastry really garnered lots of compliments! I used cod instead of sea bream, but the filo was so easy to use and the dish looked so fancy but was easy to prepare. I also used the sabayon for dessert and it was perfection for a heavy meal! I had never mixed potatoes with parsnips, never cooked with parsnips! So many of the recipes broaden the culinary repertoire! I have given this book to several friends and one couple fixed dinner for me as a thank you!
__label__1 Small calf boot: I couldn't even zip up this boot, the material didn't seem to be of high quality either. It felt like thin pleather. I ended up returning this boot as soon as I received it.
__label__2 Theology of Holiness: The word theology kind of intimated me. I assumed the book would be a little over my head but was surprised on how basic the author presented biblical truths. The book gives a solid foundation on the theology of holiness.
__label__1 not worth the cost: Simple enough truisms, just not worth the money. I would return it if the shipping back wasn't going to cost me almost as much as the purchase price. Pretty pictures, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, they should be bigger to be effective. I would want to pay about 2.99 for this book.Doesn't add anything that many other books have already stated more eloquently.
__label__1 ok for beginners: I found this tape to be much too slow, not challenging at all. I did not finish the workout as I felt I was wasting my time. A true beginner could probably benefit.
__label__1 Dissapointing documental: This film, specially the third disc, is dissapointing. I thought it would be something based on true facts, but instead of saying the things as they were, the information is manipulated and combined with opinions of people that are out and against the Catholic Church and there are quite few opinions that come from people that are in favor of the principles and doctrine of the Catholic Church, I really think that this film was made to create confusion within the faithful catholics. Spend your money in something worthy.
__label__1 pictures on web-site: when i ordered this product i was led to believe that it was more to it.i was very surprised when i recieved package only to find the total opposite of what i thought i had ordered.i am very displeased and will not order from there again.
__label__1 Glad I read these reviews before I did buy, Thanks: Thanks to the ones that did the reviews. I was all ready to purchase one and I thought I would read some of the reviews, glad I did so I am not going to buy one. I will stick with RoboForm, it works good but it is software and you can't take it with you.Termite
__label__1 Disatisfied: i purchased this item for my wife for xmas.BAD PURCHASE. IT DOESN,T WORK WITH VISTA, AND I SENT AN EMAIL To THE VENDOR ASKING IF I COULD EXCHANGE IT FOR ONE THAT WORKS WITH VISTA AND NOBODY EVEN BOTHERED TO ANSWER.SO IN THE FUTURE I WILL BUY LOCALLY.
__label__1 FLEXCIN W/CM8 JOINT HEALTH & MOBILITY SOLUTION 90 CAPS: The name of the product is correct but the picture is wrong. The product name that is being given worked for me. I took this product and my knee feels great. After I stopped taking the product, I haven't had a problem with my knee yet. If I do have a problem, I would use this product again.
__label__1 No More Eventing,Please!: I think the authors should stick to racing and I hope Christina doesn't go back to eventing,because she is a great jockey.
__label__2 Getting better: The books are getting better, adding more details about the horses and stuff like that. I really hope that some more drastic changes happen soon in the next few books. This book was definately better than the few before it. READ!
__label__1 Awful, boring, fragmented, and utterly lousy: The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock is a horribly written biography about the man himself. It is so wildly disjointed, incredibly fragmented, and surrounded by opinions, conjectures, and theories that don't collaborate well with facts. I am totally unable to follow the book because the author likes to jump around in the years of Alfred Hitchcock's life while feeding personal opinions about this or that. At the same time, there are more holes in the presentation of his background than a pound of Swiss cheese. What an awful book!
__label__1 Looks great, but that's about it: I bought a 688B in November, and have used it twice on trips of 700 miles or so. It blows open at highway speeds - the front edge actually opens 1-2 inches, allowing rain, snow, and ice to blow in. The mounting cleats also came apart after the first use. What was easy to install now takes two people and a lot of delicate alignment to match the parts up. Not at all what I would expect for what this box cost. I do not recommend it.
__label__1 blue petal mist mister: product was okay, easily knocked over, this product has past it's time. Other items have taken it's place now. Truly, the first time my dog ran past it caplouey! on the floor it went pretty, but not practical
__label__2 Wonderful way to spend a Sunday!: My family loves Agatha Christie and we especially love Poirot. This set of DVD's is a wonderful way to spend family time discussing the ins and outs of each show and each mystery. Give me more, give me more.
__label__2 I love it!: Wow, this is good. I love this CD. The lyrics, Jessicka's voice, the guitars...it rocks. Each song sounds different for the last. I love it. Black Horse Ridding Star is my favorite. Very remescent of JOJ but a original sound. A must have for any JOJ fan.
__label__1 A One-sided Report: To quote the late sacred elder of Western research and writing, C. Leland Sonnichsen, "I don't see why this book had to be written!" The reason is that the writer had pre-selected his conclusion and considered only information that tended to prove his prejudice. This is so obvious as to turn off an unbiased reader.Save your money. This book is unsliced baloney.
__label__1 Piece of crap.: I bought this a while ago but as soon as I did it was crap, the stickers are oriented incorrectly. They feel off easily. When I received it it was unattached from the key chain. Is it cheep? Yes. Does that mean it's worth it? No.
__label__2 Excellent! and Essential...: Too bad Amazon won't let me just say that for a review... So, with a few more words, let me say this is a great addition to Wyatt's regular CD catalog - 5 EPs covering his extra recordings and alternative takes from 1974 to 1998 sung in English, Spanish and in wordless instrumentals....divine.My favorite disc is the 1st from '74 (it's been a while since I had a couple of these songs on a "Virgin Sampler" Lp). I just wish they had included a 6th disc of the lovely songs he did for the documentary Winged Migration. But, almost as good as the new music and mixes, are the liner notes by Wyatt; nice to get an intimate glimpse of it all from him.These are an excellent and even essential boxed set - if you know Wyatt you'll want to get this for sure, if you don't, this ain't a bad place to start.
__label__2 Another face of Suwanai: The first half of this CD collects the melodious masterpieces, in particular, of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, while the last half does the maestro's ones. Therefore, 'Vocalise' is inserted between 'Romance' and 'Hungarian Dance,' because it is melodious as well as 'Romance.' The title implies that Suwanai likes the beautiful third part of Souvenir, 'Melody.' It surprised me because her maestro's play is famous, for example, the Violin Concerto of Tchaikovsky. Of course, 'Souvenir' of Wieniavsky here shows her maestro's character. However, she plays this Melody kindly and joyfully as if a young beautiful woman is humming. In spite of her maestro's character, she seems to love it heartly. It looks like another face of Suwanai.Technically speaking, 'Myth' of Szimanovsky fails to cooperate with the piano and at the last part of 'Vocalise' the strong violin seems to hide the beautiful stream of the piano. Despite it, '3 Melody' and '7 Vocalise' are worth listening once.
__label__2 The Best Books I've Ever Read: These books are inspirational as well as life-changing. I recommend them to anyone and everyone
__label__1 Unhappy Camper: I've only received one book at this point. I'll be very happy if I receive the other five that I ordered. Maybe they are still on the way I hope.
__label__2 Good enough case but...: If you have a relatively inexpensive racket, then this case will do. It has a padded inside, but no strap to hold your racket in place. This is important because if your racket moves around a lot inside, the edges of the rubber can become damaged.If you have an expensive racket, I recommend you get a hard case, likeKillerspin Optima Racket Case - Choose ColororKillerspin Table Tennis Racket Case.
__label__1 Inaccurate description: If you read the description of this product it clearly states that this item has a zippered pouch for carrying balls. The case I received looks like the one pictured but did not come with a zippered pouch. When I went to return it for what I ordered, Amazon would only issue a refund. Buyers beware, this description is inaccurate and misleading.
__label__2 Finally something that doesn't disappoint!: For 11 years we have owned a '97 Corolla and never found a sunshade that lasts for very long. They always begin to disintegrate, stop staying in, or just plain die. Blame the California sun.Just wanted something that was easy to install and remove, blocked most of the light and was *durable*. Finally it has arrived. This thing has been perfect, and as a rather picky consumer, I don't say that very often. It's the second one we've bought -- have already used a model that fits our Celica for 16 months.If it costs three times as much, it's because it lasts at least three times as long (and lets through NO light). Will likely "pay for itself" in the long run. Try one and reward these fine people for solving a longstanding problem!
__label__2 Understated Classic: This watch always looks appropriate. The combination of gold and stainless steel gives it an understated elegance. It is so comfortable on the wrist that you'll probably forget you have it on. I recieved this watch as a graduation gift in 1996 and its still my favortie.
__label__2 Good stuff.: Overall I like this DVD. She is high energy but not annoying...and she really gets you moving! I was actually surprised at some of the exercises - lots and lots of squats. But since she is pregnant too, it inspires you to keep up.
__label__2 Finally a good book: Finally a good book on the subject of Rennes-le-Chateau! This volume deals with all hypotheses, theories and fantasies that have been written on this theme. In this way it sends (as it should've been done long time ago) most of the fairytales to the scrapheap untill the real naked facts are revealing itselves. What is left is that the priest Saunière suddenly spent a lot of money and nobody knows for sure where it came from. Most likely from selling masses that he never held and from gifts from rich people. Tales of a treasure that he found are most likely coming from a local hotelier Corbu that had to make the area interesting to visit for tourists, because there was not much else to come for. All together a very intriguing book that reads as a detective and seperates the crap from fact. A book that we all have been waiting for.
__label__2 Pot Bellies and other Miniature Pigs: I have been looking for a good book about Pot Bellied Pigs for a long time, and I belive this book to be excellent. It is packed full of useful information and has the cutest pictures you will ever see. I recommend this book to any PBP owner if they are new to this wonderful pet or if they have had one for years. I don't believe that you will be disappointed.
__label__2 Wonderful!: I picked this up on a whim and didn't read it right away, but I am sooo glad I finally did! I really enjoyed this book and I sometimes have a hard time being "captured" by a book. I tend to put them down unfinished and I read this in one day!! Excellent!
__label__2 Not the best: If your getting started with this thinks this is a good beginning. its not the strongest but it certainly works.
__label__1 wildside DVD: I had seen this movie previously on VHS and the DVD version seems to have deleted a couple of scenes (or at least one scene) and soI was disapointed.
__label__1 hold your horses....: Ok...lousy script, main chick nothing special,16 minutes of most important stuff are missing etc.Violence looks really stupid as main character has more money than god.Police, as usual, violate law.
__label__2 Perfect replacement: This is exactly what I needed. It is faster than the old one was when it was new so I give it points for that.
__label__1 I am unhappy with this order: I bought this watch in the early september, 2012, but it did not work any more in the middle October, 2012. It stopped working even I screwed the crown! It can't be rewound manually. I am so disappointed! How can I get it fixed? I want to return it but I am in China now! It's not convenient to do that.
__label__2 good buy: I had a surprisingly tough time finding a BASIC bow case. Grab this one while you can. Constructed pretty well and seems like it will last.
__label__2 A great baseball game!!!: Its a great baseball game!!! My son and I have played some of the two player stuff and I am doing the single player career mode. Its been alot of fun. I would give it the max stars but that would state it is prefect which is just not possible. So it got four stars. :) Five stars for fun. :)
__label__2 A Fun Game: I love the MLB series for the PS1 so I gave this a shot. It's fun to play, but the controls were a little difficult to figure out. Once I understood them, it was fun. It's worth getting if you are a baseball fan.
__label__1 Obviously Defective - So Why Send It?: Nice looking machine, but obviously nobody even looked to see if it worked before sending it to me. #1 - It would not boot up in XP, just froze at every attempt. #2 - the battery would not charge, as clearly shown by the indicator light. I was able to fix the boot-up by going to Safe mode and running Defrag and Scandisk. The battery problem was not fixable - It is simply defective. Despite all the trouble, I'd still like to keep the machine, but there is no option to replace the battery only. There's no "Contact Seller" button available for this transaction and all I am left to do is return it. Whole effort - Waste of Time. I Hate Wastes of Time!
__label__1 This device was a let down due to the problems in upgrading the hard drive. Do to buy this type in the future.: This device was a let down due to the problems in upgrading the hard drive. Do to buy this type in the future.
__label__1 Initially impressed, would not buy it again.: After 6 months of very sporadic use our Pleo stopped working.All symptoms suggest battery or charger problem.To our surprise, we found out that Pleo is covered by 90 day warranty only.New battery is $50 plus s/h, new charger $25 + s/h, but I am not sure what is broken and I am not willing to spend more money on this thing.
__label__2 Interesting Toy: Pleo, was a gift for my daughter (9yrs). She loves it. I had reviewed the consumer comments from Amazon and made the decition to purchase one. I was expecting the dinosaur to sleep for a long time (newborn stage) but within 3-4 hour Pleo was active. Know we download behaviors and see him act differently. I did purchase an extra battery because according to the comments at Amazon the batteries charge for 10hrs. But that was not the case. They charge for 4hours. The only downfall is the "skin" it is very gentle and within 1-2 days you can see wear and minor tearing were my daughter pets him. Reading the manual all you really need is to pat him, his sensor will pick up that you are touching him but to avoid any further damage we purchased dog attire to cover him. Overall, I love the toy and love to see my daughter discover something new about him.
__label__1 Poore!: The battery is very bad, quality of the color surface is also bad, overall it doesn't meet my expectations.
__label__1 Well, Let Me Tell You: This author must not have much value of herself by writing this book. She berates the family that she was born into, but excuses all the things she did in life. If she thought her home life was so bad, then why didn't she do something to better herself than sleep around, and then feel the need to tell the entire world about it. Maggie sounds like a very insecure person who wants people to feel sorry for her. Too bad she can't find the courage to make the world a better place to live in, instead of berating her family.
__label__1 Once Twice ....NEVER AGAIN: First set i replaced with Bosch lasted a short time (I did not keep track) i bought a second set when the first went bad and then i did keep track .....2 years 3 months 7485 miles . my controller is working fine ! now i am shopping again FOR GLOW PLUGS MADE BY ANYONE ELSE !
__label__1 Only 3 good songs.(in my opinion): I am a BIG Switchblade Symphony fan, and I was constantly hearing about their version of "Lucky Star", but I was a bit disapointed by it. The good points to this CD to me seem to be: "Erotica"(Razed In Black) "Skin"(I'm not sure who redid this one, I don't have the artist listing with me) and "Like a Prayer"(Biggod 20? ;o) ) If there is any reason to buy this cd, I would definately say it would be for the version of "Like a Prayer"; I couldn't get this version out of my head for days. I can't even listen to the version of "Cherish" anymore, or I'll pee my pants laughing. As immature as it sounds, I can't help myself.
__label__1 False Prophets: Even a Madonna loyalist would flinch at most of these sad remixes. Testimony to the phrase "Don't fix what ain't broke."One would think that having a variety of Madonna songs sung by male vocalists would be an interesting change of pace. Well the pace has certainly changed but is interesting for all the wrong reasons.Most will have never heard of the selected bands offering these tributes and for good reason. It is unfortunate to have heard of them at all; far worse to hear them butcher these songs.Do yourself a big favor and just listen to Madonna get it right all over again on your old CDs.
__label__2 It got rid of my appetite: I am glad Dexatrim came out with something to compete with other products. This product worked very well for me. I have tried Hoodia, but it gave me a headache. This product is mild and totally gets rid of my cravings for sweet, junk food.I've determined I definitely needed to take something to control my appetite while I am on an exercise regimine. I'm not jittery at all with this. It has lots of B vitamins and chromium picolinate. It has as much caffeine as one cup of coffee per pill. I brought this with me for a long business trip on a plane. When I had no access to food (long plane flight) it worked excellent! Plus, it's cheaper than many other products. Although, I would like to try NV next. The only thing is sometimes it keeps me awake at night if I take it too close to bedtime, so beware of that
__label__1 Worked for one day: I am very open-minded and decided to give this product a chance - despite the reviews. I paid $22 for it and considered taking it back at first. The first day it worked all right but the second pill later in the day gave me a pressure headache. My appetite was suppresed mildly for the first two days but nothing the following days, in fact I felt hungrier, weird. I tried. Now I am trying NV.
__label__2 Exactly what I needed: I got exactly what I wanted out of this product. I have had no problems and no complaints. I like that it came with an extra watch strap and battery. Overall no problems.
__label__2 listening for years: These are masterpieces of the literature. Few 20th centurystring quartets are full of light. These are. The reviewer below (above) from Australia who mentions "atonal"is as far off the mark as one could get. These are supremely tonal pieces, in fact very conservatively so. In fact,there is not an atonal moment in them, they are more firmly rooted in tonal centers than even Bartok, Hindemith and Ravel quartets of the early part of the century. The comments about small fragments are correct however. These are mosaic structures of great beauty. Other quartets which are crafted similarly are those by Stravinsky. Imagine a more Slavic flavor and you have Janacek.
__label__2 Arrived a week late: The hat is perfect, but the order arrived about a week overdue.Stupid word limit needs a lot more words.
__label__2 Does what its supposed to do: Better than the ones that friends and neighbors have let me try. The fit is right; choose smaller. Lightweight. Not easy to get on and off but then there's a purpose to be served with this appliance and it has to fit tight to work. I am a high-mileage runner and have very narrow feet. My plantar fasciitis has been hanging around too long and nothing seems to be working so only time will tell if this is "the cure". I would recommend this splint.
__label__2 AMAZING RELIEF!: This product MUST be tried to be believed. I actually received it through my doctor's office (not through Amazon) but you must know that after 4 years of pain so AWFUL that I could barely walk to school and pick-up my children and pain so HORRIBLE that I could not walk downstairs to wash laundry (I would have my kids running all over the place) - I have used THIS PRODUCT for 1 week and my heel pain is almost gone in the morning. ALMOST GONE! How on earth is that? Because my foot is kept at a GENTLE 90 degree angle stretch. That's why. You will be amazed.My heel still becomes a little sore if I wear not padded shoes or if I am hiking...but THE NIGHT SPLINT has changed my life. It has given me hope and put me in a better mood!LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!Is it uncomfortable??? NO! Can you tell it's there...SURE but it's totally worth it!
__label__1 Simply did not work: Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore.
__label__2 So warm and full of Christmas!: This sweet story is so charmingly illustrated and written. Cozy and thoughtful, full of love and Christmas spirit. We have loved this book year round, and value its message of the season.
__label__2 Inventive music, no viola: I agree with the amazon.com review above, but should mention one error: there's no viola on the CD. In Brazilian Portugese, "violao" means acoustic guitar and "guitarra" means electric guitar. I don't know if that will trouble many listeners, though, given the clever mix of jazz and MPB on this CD. Two talented performers.
__label__1 You get what you pay for..: I bought this headset for my sons for christmas who are 3yrs & 5yrs. These headsets were adjustable, but at the largest size were still totight on their little heads. These headsets must have been sized foran infants head instead of a kids head. Even my 3yr old couldn't wearthem. The two stars is only for the ability for the boys to talk to eachother, but they have to move the earphones up to their ears to hear sincethey can not wear them on their heads. You get what you pay for, so ifyou have kids with extremely little heads this is the headset for you.Otherwise get a better set and spend the extra $.
__label__1 some interesting points, generally difficult to read: Perhaps the book is too specialized for me as amateur history-enthusiast (although i found this book via a recommended reading for 1st year history students). I found this book tedious and often did not have much of an idea what point the author was trying to make here. I liked his discussion of the role of women and monasteries as institutionalized memory of medieval society.I am curious to see what others found of this book. I, for one, will not read this book again.
__label__2 A charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen: Based on a true story of a girl's pet hen who would sneak into the family home through the cat door and lay an egg on the child's colored quilt, The Chicken Without A Coop by Kathleen Cameron is a charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen who, when left behind by her human family, befriends Columbus the Cat and his young owner Katy. Simple and inviting color illustrations by John Wilson add a special touch to this heartwarming story of acceptance.
__label__1 A good plot concept that never carries through: This book was a serious disappointment. The delightful romance promised by the back cover cannot carry the rest of the dragging plot through. The biggest disappointment was the characters: the hero is thoroughly unlikeable and almost out of the regency mindset (what kind of "gentleman" would attempt to seduce a virginal lady?). The attempted interaction of the town people falls flat on its face, too. The few flashes of wittiness cannot make up for the wholly uninspiring content of the story.By the middle of the book, I just wanted it to be done. But I was on vacation with nothing else to read, so I finished it off. The ending makes up, perhaps, the rest of the book. But, in a regency, the ending is always good, so this is nothing unusual.
__label__1 Trivial content makes for an incomplete reference: This book really isn't bad; it just seems so incomplete.It really does a good job of describing the changes to game that Planes of Power provides. All the level 60 plus spells are listed along with the high level disciplines. And the map section is useful, being limited to "lowbie" areas outside the major cities; occasionally handy to have all in one place. There is a decent description of many of the "new" planes, with a listing of monsters.It is not, however, a complete, "latest and greatest" reference to the Everquest game. In my opinion, an up-to-date, complete reference is sorely needed.
__label__1 bad belt, don't buy it: it sucked! the plastic burned thru and i could smell the burning and the foam inside was burning as well
__label__1 unecessary review: The cable is fine.The emails and this review are unecessary and a nuisance.please take me of any further mailing lists.If I have a problem I'll let you know.I personally feel advertising in America is intrusive and much too aggressive.Help me when I ask for it, then leave me alone.see ya,Oren
__label__2 Great for the Acer Aspire One or any other Netbook out there!: I just ordered this last week and I love it, very snappy, plays DVD's burns CD's, you can boot an ISO from it in the BIOS no problem. Powered by the USB which is more awesome!This drive saved me a request for servicing my Aspire One, I just plugged it in, inserted the disk, booted my copy of Windows XP, fixed the Master Boot Record and I was back to normal.Great product, great seller.Make sure you DON'T PAY $79.99 for this. The other sellers have it for just $29.99 and it's worth every penny, these sellers are just as good as buying from Amazon directly, shipping wasn't bad either.
__label__1 External drive: This unit looks good but came with no instructions and no ability to troubleshoot. There was always an error message stating: unknown device and unit requires an external power supply to function properly.
__label__1 A bit much...: The Simon Weisenthal Center and the Jewish Defense League compiled the statistics for this report. That said, it should be stated that the "bias" level is a tad high. The reader is subjected to page after page of dry statistics accompanied by text that borders on being hateful itself. Details like political climate, economics and cultural trends are brushed over in favor of a self-serving agenda. I critiqued this book/survey rather harshly because their are so many other books that give a much better account of global Neo-Nazi activity and manage to be informative and objective at the same time.
__label__2 Russian Spectacular music at its best: Divine voice. If only I understood russian. I have had prior 2 or 3 CDs both vocals and non-vocal of russian spectacular music. This tops them all. The voice of Dimitri Hvorostovsky is simply divine. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a great voice and russian popular songs.
__label__2 Ordinary Joy: Prior to my reading Ordinary Joy, had Jesus Christ walked right up to me, I most cetainly would have missed Him. Now there is a chance that I will recognize Him every day for the rest of my life. This read has truly made me feel loved by God.
__label__1 Waste: It's simply an aweful item. I bought it brand new, with no scratches, but the disc behaved like I had scratched it up terribly. It would skip all over. We could never finish a game because it would just return to the main menu after half way through any game. Maybe I just got a faulty disc but if not, the item is terrible.
__label__1 Fun as you want to make it: The theory of this game is fun, but it really is based on the 1960's game. The people in the video are from that era and the culture of the questions as well. It was fun because we all got silly about the questions, but an updated version would be awesome.
__label__1 Not what was advertised: When I ordered this game I thought I was getting the new up to date version. The description is misleading.
__label__2 PAINTS PICTURES: Great artwork and very creative production. Check out the video which is on the CD. As good as his other albums and has created his own niche. Would like to hear more of Allan's vocal ability and possibly some chorus's. Otherwise delighted with this imaginative piece of work.
__label__1 A big let-down: As a fan I couldn't wait to get my greasy little fingers on the new release from the talented Mr Wilder. Well,what a disappointment. He seems besotted with narrative(which is highly effective and evocative in small doses)which rages and groans across virtually every track on what could have been a superb album,with its eerie backdrops of creepy samples and various other suitable noises. The previous release was more accessible,especially the vocals.This one is rather overpowering,and the only tracks that succeed are 'Want", 'Vertigen' and 'Black box part 2'. Alan Wilder should ditch the awful rappers and concentrate more on his creative keyboards.
__label__2 Paris Bistro comes to US: I have been to Paris and am familiar with several of the bistros profiled in this book. Their cookery is FABULOUS!! Ms. Danenberg has chosen well and the recipes are not only delicious but very satisfying. I can now bring Paris bistro cooking home!
__label__1 Side Effects?: I have a 25lb beagle that is a little over a year old. I had previously given 3 drops of the calming treatment but had seen no effect. Recently, a good friend of mine moved into my apartment and caused a bit of anxiety in my dog. I gave her 4 drops and she was fine for the rest of the night. The following day however, she was very lethargic and not very responsive to play and yawned an unusually large amount. As with the other review on this product, my dog also had muscle spasms or tremors. It was not really clear what they were. If purchasing this product, i would definitely be very careful with the amounts and see how dogs react. Honestly, i have been using pet naturals calming treats instead and they work just as well and have no side safest i have seen of.
__label__1 I'll Wait for CDs: The makers of this product need to "modernize" it and make it available on CDs. Till then, I'll just wait.
__label__2 Must-read for African Missionaries!: This book is an overview of the truths of the Christian faith as seen from the perspective of the traditional African world view. It is insightfully written from a Western perspective and is extremely helpful in understanding the difficulties of relating Christianity to the African's beliefs -- both modern and indiginous. This is a must-read for anyone going into the mission field in Africa, no matter how much theology you've studied or how much you already know about African religions. Great for general knowledge or to look in-depth at specific issues.
__label__2 Musee d'Orsay: High quality art book that is not intimidating or daunting. It is not a "reference piece"; it is an enjoyable trip through the museum. Just enought text and detail to let you enjoy/explore/experience each piece of art.
__label__1 poorly done!: i just found this dvd annoying. The music attempts to evoke the feeling of a young trendy viewer, although the narrator sounds like Robin Leach. Most of the suggestions, boutique and hotel- wise are for tourists with 'beaucoup bucks' to spend, not very practical! This guide shows more of the inside of premises' than the outdoor scenery, and left me feeling empty. It does give you a nice 2-minute glimpse of the canal, street and park views but not nearly enough.
__label__1 THIS CHANNEL NEEDS TO GO OFF AIR!: This was one of the worst serial killer thrillers I have ever read. I found the entire novel incredibly boring, sluggish, and unsuspenseful. The main character, Lucas Frank, was poorly developed and Felix, the killer, did not seem like a good candidate for a serial killer. It was a good thing that this novel was short because, the book was not exciting and seemed to take a long time to get through, even though it was only 322 pages. I did not like the ending either. I felt John Philpin did not do a good job with the conclusion of this novel. There were so many flashbacks throughout the entire novel that it drove me crazy. I have read many good novels this year, but "The Murder Channel" was definitely not one of them. Be smart and save your money.
__label__2 Love: We love this puzzle! It's way cute! The colors are so vibrant and I love the large block style puzzle pieces, they are much more durable!
__label__1 Should Be Extinct: I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off.
__label__2 Amazing book, just the kind I was looking for.: I have been interested in European Indian relations for almost a year now, and I have read many books on the subject. This book is great in the way that if gives you,1. a chronicle of the Indians from before Columbus to present.2. For the most part a non bias account of the events that shaped European and Indian relations. It talks about what the Indians got out of working with the Europeans and motives for converting.3. A vast amount of illustrations, maps and primary documents about important events.Instead of looking for another book about Euro-Indian relations just get this one. It is a textbook but trust me it is a great source and answered all of the questions I had.
__label__2 Overall good phone: I've had this phone for about a year now. As a phone its pretty good as far as voice quality and reception. It fits well in the palm of the hand and in pocket. The keyboard is very handy for entering info into the phonebook. The Camera also takes good pictures for a phone camera.My phone did have an issue with charging and retaining charge of the battery (as also mentioned by someone else in their review). I took it to a local T-Mobile store and they filled out a warranty form to get it exchanged and received a replacement in 4 days. So far no problems with the replacement phone.Overall functions very well as a phone and is very stylish. Just watch out for potential issue with charging and retaining charge
__label__1 Inherent batter problem: This phone did not charge after about a month of use. I sent it in and got a new one. Now the new one won't charge either. This could be a model misdesign.
__label__2 Magia de las frutas y vegetales: Salud cocina y belleza: I purchased this book for my mother because she had checked it out at her library and love it. She has made several recipes out of the book and she says they are delicious and easy.
__label__2 INCREDIBLE: I don't know what these reviewers are talking about. First of all the package is by Philips not Sony. I don't hear any hiss at all when I listen to it (is this reviewer talking about the right one?) Also I think the comparison with Gould is bad. These partitas made little impression on me when I heard Gould play them. When I heard Tureck play them it was like a revelation. She plays Bach with a soul, they breath and live. Listening to these recordings brings in euphoria. These recordings are some of the most beautiful I have in all my piano cds. They are like magic. I have lots of other Bach cds including Gould and Fischer, but these partitas are what I come back to again and again. I don't want to criticize Gould on Bach because he is a genius; but if all you heard is Gould then you don't know Bach. Gould and Tureck play Bach differently and they are both worth hearing. Sorry my personal preference for Bach is this CD, It is my favorite. Strongly recommended.
__label__1 Read this book together with Dan Neuharth's book: Al Neuharth's son, Dan Neuharth, has written a book called: "If You Had Controlling Parents: How To Make Peace With Your Past and Find Your Place In the World" [...]If you read the son's book first and then read this book, you will find Al Neuharth's view of himself as "lovable" quite a fantasy. The son's book is excellent help for adult children of narcissistic parents, and quite well reviewed, unlike this book.I'm not sure that success in business or publishing even requires the enormous betrayals Al Neuharth performed to others in his industry or to his family.
__label__1 Powerbrush has failed twice: After 6 months the Powerbrush failed and was replaced for free, that brush lasted 10 months before it too failed. The cost of the replacement is more than the original vacuum! Also the suction capability of the cleaner was less than desirable. Bag-less is nice, but overall it's a disappointment and now useless.
__label__1 Loved it - Hated it: I own a small residential cleaning company and bought two of these. They worked great on carpet, and they look pretty cool, too. Easy to open to get rid of the dirt and debris and not too loud. But both broke within 2 months. Both of the hoses pulled away (fixed with a hose clamp) and the way the debris container fits into the body of the vacuum - you have to tilt it very slightly then pull it out - it was a given that someone was going to pull it straight out and break off the little plastic piece eventually - which they did. Going for something a little more substantial next time, although I think these might be good for someone with mostly carpeting, who lived in a ranch-style house with only one floor (a bit heavy to carry up stairs).
__label__2 Awesome Set of Lights at an affordable price: i just purchased 2 of these lights to add to my set up and they are awesome, I also purchased the eliminator tri 32 light stand to go with these lights definately a good product for any budget.
__label__1 waste of time and money: Nothing on this cd is even close to his other stuff ! Gay Robot is the only kinda funny track. Dont bother buying this !!
__label__1 A failed attempt to improve on an old standard: I bought this cord because I was tired of the way the plastic lip always breaks on the Canon version and this one has a metal plate on the mount instead of plastic, so I thought that might solve the problem. The metal plate is a good idea, but the way the head is mounted on the plate with a screw, it got loose the first weekend I used it and there was no way to tighten it, so the flash and mount wobbled and spun around on the screw. Not helpful.
__label__1 Irving and History: Buyer Beware!: See:"Denying the Holocaust", Deborah Lipstadt (1993)"Lying about Hitler", Richard J. Evans (2001)"Evidence for Auschwitz: Evidence from the Irving Trial", R. J. Van Pelt (2002)David Irving sued Lipstadt in British court for libel. Richard Evans was an expert witness for Lipstadt. Evans' book chronicles the trial and presents overwhelming evidence (under oath and with cross examination) that Irving's entire body of work is riddled with falsehoods and outright fabrications. See the Amazon reviews of Evans' book.
__label__1 The Emperor's New Clothes: The Free Design, huh? Now they're hip, eh? Feh. The emperor's new clothes.
__label__2 Nice book!: I ordered this book for my class and was very pleased when it arrived! My students will appreciate all of the pictures it contains! The price was also great! Thank you!
__label__1 yup, this thing stinks: It rewinded the first tape ok, except the START button wouldn't stay down. I had to keep the button down with my finger.But on the second tape STOP button got stuck and somehow it eat the tape.I got it from radio shack, it's going back there tomorrow.
__label__2 What Happened to My Rebate?: I was supposed to get a $30 rebate on this, as a renewing customer with Norton SystemWorks, but the system never offered it to me. It seems to have been a shill that never came through -- emphasized in the promo headline, but never offered in a tangible way I could take advantage of. [...]
__label__1 It's like stealing!: You buy the program (SystemsWorks 2005), and when you try to use it you get error messages that some of the files didn't install. Try over again, you're told. It was a chore the first time. So you try to get in touch with Symantec, via email or otherwise. Forget email for techical help. "Otherwise"--that'll cost you $30 for a program out of the box only a few hours and you can't get to work for faults in their program.. I've used Norton from the time he first started out, and he was good, excellent. Now, maybe he's too rich and doesn't care.Terribly frustrated
__label__1 Misleading Product Description: Item Description claims a power output of 140 watts continuous, 150 watts for 20 minutes and 500 watts peak. Packaging on this inverter claims 85 watts contiuous, 85 watts for 10 minutes and 170 watts peak. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU REQUIRE MORE POWER !!!
__label__1 not working at all well...: new 2350 ..does not print. lexmark web page does not list this model?? so can not look at FAQ and "online support" has not responded with a solution ..so far I have waited 27 hours for their response. Booklet shows no example of what test page should look like? nor does the website...wish I could bill them for my time ...so far a definate 2 thumbs down ..will probably return this tomorrow?
__label__1 Redo's and Such Stuff: Well, it's as bad music as you might think but its up to you how bad.The Byrds, Mr. Tambourine Man must of redone by their original equipment manager!The Animals, The House of the Raising Sun was no better off than the mentioned above.Gerry & The Pacemakers, How Do You Do It was reduced to a instrumental with no vocals at all...OMG.Their disclaimer: "Some of the tracks are re-recordings made by the original artists or a member of the original group. This album also includes some live-recordings"This is unworthy of your attention or moneyWalk by this quickly.
__label__2 THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!!!!: Jack on the tracks is and awesome book and I think everyone should read it!!! I don't want to give any of the book away but if you read this you will be howling with laughter after the first few chapters!!!!!!!!!! I loved this book so much that I'm writing 2 reports on it for school. A salute to Jack Gantos for writing a great book!!!!!
__label__2 The wack jack: Jack on the Tracks is a funny book . If you enjoy anything funny then this is a good book to read . My favorite part is when Jack was watching the news and lightningstruck their t.v. Jacks mom was screaming her head off while smoke was coming out of their t.v. Or when his cat froze to death because it got stck in the freezer.If anyone enjoys a good laugh I would recommend this book to them .
__label__1 Inconsistent flashes: For the first couple weeks it worked ok, only sometimes flashed at consistent intervals at the really low setting. Now however, it's only consistent at the highest settings and hardly works at the lower ones. I guess it's what you get for the price.
__label__2 Beautiful Disney Movie Song Instrumental Lullabies: I was tired of listening to the same Baby Einstein Lullaby cd over and over again while getting my little one to sleep. This Disney Instrumental Lullaby cd is perfect! It has numerous Disney movie songs turned into beautiful instrumental lullabies. It's very soothing and not too loud or fast. I highly recommend it!
__label__2 Great CD: My 3 year old little princess loves this cd. She listens to it for almost every nap and wants to fall to sleep with it at night too. Very pretty and relaxing music. Would highly recommend!
__label__2 WONDERFUL!!!!: Coming from a music fanatic this is the best!! Great background music for life. I even play this when we have company. Everyone is familiar with these classics. My children all love it. Sometimes to jazz things up we sing along (it is instrumenatl only). I have never rated anything on Amazon but when I heard this I just had to write about it. Hope this was helpful. I have wasted a lot of money on CD's that were a dissapointment.Love this CD!!
__label__2 One of our daughter's favorites: We gave this to our daughter for Christmas, when she was 18 months old. She loves it, and it has helped her learn shapes. She hasn't had any interest in the page with the alphabet yet. The flaps in the book (with the exception of just one) are holding up well with all the wear. This is a great book to take on long car rides. Lots to keep a little one interested, and all in one piece.
__label__2 My Grandson loves Thomas: This was no exception,he will watch these over and over.The toy train is an added bonus.For the price you can't go wrong.
__label__2 Buy this DVD: If you're thinking about buying this or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed, the production quality is top notch, the concert is excellent, and the documentary is funny and interesting.
__label__2 Clarke Boland Of Course: The Clarke Boland Orchestra were never really known in the USA. Kenny Clarke - American drummer with Francy Boland - Belgian piano player and composer along with a mixture of international musicians was a group of stunning interpreters of jazz. Three Latin Adventures is one of their more unusual choices but the compositions and the playing is very tight and if you love jazz with a latin flavour then do not miss this cd.
__label__1 Save your money: Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste 10 dollars, you can rip up a 10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would.
__label__1 Not that great at strengthing...good at breaking nails though!: I have been looking for a more natural nail treatment that could strengthen my nails. I started to use this product when my nails started to get longer, but instead of strengthening my nails, I found they were more prone to breaking.And the way my nails would break would be in like a straight line as if they were cut. It didn't look jagged or ripped off at all, which meant I didn't have much loss of my nails or a good deal of cutting/filing in order to fix my nail.I am going to look for a better nail treatment because this one is causing me problems that I have never had before and don't want to have again. It could just be my nails, but if you do try this out, you have been warned!
__label__1 Good as decoration, but not poseable: Face detail: Excellent (helmet detail, helmet not removeable)Overall Body detail: ExcellentFabric clothes: No. Plastic clothes limit poseability.Accesories: Laser cannon, very detailed, it fires a projectile.Movie accuracy: ExcellentIssues: Legs are not straight so it looks weird without the cannon.Benchmarking: Not the best snowtrooper out there.PoseabilityShoulder articulation: StandardElbow articulation: NoHip articulation: StandardKnees articulation: NoFeet articulation: NoNotice I use this nomenclature for articulations.No: It has no articulation.Standard: Rotates around a single axis. Provides limited poseability.Ball: Provides the best poseability.
__label__1 I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers: Avoid this book unless you crave corny and woefully outdated 'insults' and 'jokes' (which were anything but funny). Have not read other books of this genre, so I cannot make a recommendation of another title. My only recommendation is NOT to buy this book.
__label__2 The First "Men In Black": In 1952, the author, Albert Bender, founded one of the first organizations to seriously study flying saucers. Starting in New England, his organization quickly grew to be an international network of observers and information gatherers until -- Bender told them all to stop! He claimed that he had come too close to the truth and now was in danger from -- the men in black. What did he find out? Why are they here? Mankind must be warned. Read this terrifying book!
__label__2 It helped me heal: I loved this book! Even though I cried through much of it, it served a useful purpose. After never wanting to have children, I had a revelation that I needed to experience the joys of motherhood. I recently had a miscarriage with my first and much wanted pregnancy. I was a mess. This book helped me get over some of the loss I felt. I still feel sad often but realize that I'm not supposed to "Just get over it, already!" The book was honest, sad, hopeful, real, and made me totally feel like I was not alone in my grief. I am hopeful and anxious to finish this book by reading the chapters about trying again, coping with a subsequent pregnancy and birth, and the other chapters I know one day I will read when I feel ready to embark on the scary but exciting journey of pregnancy. I also feel compelled to share this with anyone who has gone through the death of a child. Thank you Deborah Davis, Ph.D. for the gift of this book!
__label__2 fun!: These shoes are sexy and comfortable. For sure fun for your special someone. I got them right on time and they were even hotter in person. I think they make legs and feet look better than other HIGH HIGH heels I have bought before.
__label__2 excellent gore movie: sorry but creep is an excellent horror movie lots of gore blood and creeping section is very ok i've seen it twice already and the second vision is better i bought the england dvd before and i recommend this movie to all amateurs of gore bye marc
__label__1 THIS ITEM IS NOT A BOOK!: This is a box set of stationery with some of the same illustrations as the Mouse Tales books--this is NOT the books themselves! The product description doesn't clearly indicate this.Very cute--but if you're looking for the books themselves, don't buy it.
__label__1 not what I thought it was gonna be: They definately should have had pics of the inside of the bag...that way I would have known that it wasn't a case. If it would have been a case it would have been a beautiful one. So sorry to have to send it back...but totally not what I had expected.
__label__2 Simple product for remembering: Well made bag and labeled for easily finding your wheel locks. Leave the bag in your glove box or attach the velcroe strap to the cars' tire tool for easy finding.
__label__2 Good tool at a good price.: This is a low end miter saw that works just fine. I like this saw because it is light weight and can be hauled around for smaller jobs. I give this saw 5 stars because in the same price range you are looking at either Ryobi or Firestorm(black and decker).....I would say Hitachi has the better reputation and my experience with the Hitachi brand has been good.As far as the instruction booklet? I only opened it to see that I received all included parts. I only had to install a few items which took 5 minutes. Perhaps the one I got from Lowes was pre-assembled? The 1 star rating seems unfair for that considering the limited tools required and parts included.I can't comment on the table mounts (as others have) since I probably will only use it as a small portable.
__label__2 For light duty work, great saw.: Considering Home Depot wanted like $120 to rent a saw for a week this is a no brainer if you have a big home project to do. I have put down about 240 feet of baseboard cut with this saw without any problems or complaints. The baseboard I am using is the fiberboard preprimed stuff. The blade that comes with the saw worked great, no tear out or chipping. Not sure about real wood, I have a feeling a different blade would be needed for that. Now, as I stated in the title, I believe this to be a light duty saw, occasional weekend projects that sort of thing. Don't think it would stand up to the daily strain a contractor would put it through.
__label__1 Sad, sad, sad: I was so excited to get this book and then realized it was really advertising for the book clients are to use. If you flip through this book you will see on each page the authors site their book SO MANY TIMES.... we are educated people and they can't stop citing the book we are reading. Not very helpful sadly.
__label__1 I've read worse, but I've read better too.: The book: Lie to Me is one that I am quite torn on. On the one hand, it deals with subjects that I wasn't too comfortable reading, and as such, almost didn't finish it.On the upside though, it does have a surprise ending that you could easily miss figuring out through the book if you're not paying attention. (Though personally I think that the author gives way too many hints at the big secret. I had it figured out about 2/3 way through the book)Worth a read, but get it from the library.
__label__2 the butcher's deadly crew: Wall to wall gore and brutality.Was I glad when this one was finally over? You bet.Not certain how much of this actually happened the way they claim,but it sure as hell seems to me the writers come mighty close.Might turn some stomachs, might leave others numb--or both.Makes the characters in The Godafather look like boy scouts.
__label__1 True only if pigs fly: One would think that the authors of this book, being employed or having been employed by reputable newspapers, would know to check their facts. Their "true" story is at least partly fiction. Told through the perspective of a biased bystander with limited intelligence and perception, the "facts" as they pertain to at least one of the characters are almost completely fictitious. There are other factual errors that are glaring. It seems Mustain and Capeci had no problem sacrificing journalistic integrity to the gods of sensationalism and profit. The authors and publisher should be grateful that they were not sued for libel.
__label__2 MURDER MACHINE: IT'S ABOUT MY DAD AND HIS FRIENDS.IT'S TRUE AND PAINFULL.IF YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT THE "REAL" GANGSTERS, THIS IS THE BOOK.WHEN BAD BOY GOTTI IS AFRAID, THEY WERE BAD FELLOWS.
__label__2 Absolutely off da hook!: As usual, Willie Ninja does it again. This man should be deemed the king of house...
__label__1 Eh, could do without this one.: Thought this would be great, liked the graphics, thought Pandora kicked butt, but not so thrilled now that I have played it. Great for teens, probably, but not me. Going to try to sell it to GameStop.
__label__1 purely contrived & cliched: generic songs, cheezy lyrics, stereotypical in every way. Priest initially invented the heavier aspects of metal in the late 70s early 80s...had their last truely creative and heaviest album in 1984 (defenders of the faith)...after that they took 2 years off. They saw the trends in metal change to bonjovi,poison,etc...so they copied that formula for turbo and ram it down purely to sell records. most fans didnt accept that. After that, they decided, well then lets go back to being heavier...but by the late 80s heavier was slayer, anthrax, etc. So they copied that formula as well. But once again it's so phony and generic, just to sell records. Bottom line is they sold out after 84's defenders album, and priest ceased to be priest after that.
__label__1 horrible: this is one of priests worst albums, nightcrawler is only good for 12 year old kids, leather rebel is horrible. for a good priest album buy 'sad wings of destiny.'
__label__2 ONE SHOT OF THE GREATEST GLORIES OF PRIEST!!!: THe Gods Takes the NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Metal) To Thrash/Speed! With Scott Travis, A Much Better Drummer, No Afence on Dave he was good too. Nice Starting! A way To Introduse Us To Is Drumming Power! The Guitar Sounds Powerful To! This Is Worth Listening too! If You Don't Have it, Hurry Up And Get It Damn You cause your missing the Metal Fun!
__label__2 Orgainized!: I saw this shelf at a friends house and thought it was a great idea! It does a nice job at organizing small pieces and parts of toys while having them in view, so my son can grab the bin he wants.Assembly literally took 10 minutes, but was easiest with two people.The only thing we didn't like is the whole thing is so light, we had to anchor it to prevent my child from pulling it down on himself.
__label__2 Real-Life examples: This book rocks, its probably the best math book i have ever used, it has lots of real life problems, along with lots of pictures and information to help you learn! Great job larson and staff!
__label__2 Bulbs are Cheap; Batteries are Not: Okay, the light wedge is really the best book light on the planet, and I think I have purchased every light on the market. Yet, it uses batteries fast, especially if you tend to fall asleep with the light on and it burns most of the night. :)The Original Itty Bitty is the best for at-home use. You plug it in near the bed and no worry about batteries. Eventhough I leave it on, nothing has caught afire.I had one for years and finally it refused to light, the charger I think. Nothing is perfect, and nothing lasts forever. This is pretty darned close.Be glad it's still available.
__label__1 Come on already!: Enough of these money hungry pigs! Enough of this season 4 vol.1 Or season 1 vol.2 crap! Give us the complete series in one package already. And make it so us common folk can afford to buy this series that we love! PLEASE!!!
__label__2 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Season Three, Volume Two: Great to see the old series reborn. Once again a great job by Amazon.Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Season Three, Volume Two
__label__1 NOT INTENDED FOR CONSUMPTION!: Not tasty... and almost impossible to chew at all! Items are pretty, but seriously, have no taste and are like chewing rubber.
__label__2 Awesome: These are the greatest things in the world. At the prices on Amazon you can't loose. Definatly a good buy.
__label__2 Very Useful: I don't know about you, but I have neither the financial resources, time, or particular desire to try and keep up with the novels. FASA realizes this, so they give us Shattered Sphere.Basically, this book is a status update, similar to the long-out-of-print 30-year Update book, published just before the Clans appeared. It doesn't go into great detail on anything, but is very general about everything. It's told from the point of view of Victor Steiner-Davion's intelligence chief, so there is a bit of bias there (i.e. Draconis Combine's okay, but the Capellans and Katherine Steiner-Davion are EVIL).It's a very, very handy book. It should be a required purchase for anyone who owns Mechwarrior 3rd edition, and if you're at all interested in the politics behind the universe, for Battletech fans, too. If there'd been more (like, say, if it'd been twice the size), it'd've gotten five stars.
__label__1 Yuck!: I love Boba, but when I recieved this product- one of the bags the seal was broken and the pearls were desintegrated. When I opened the other bag these also fell apart. The color and texture were not what I had recieved before when I mail ordered from another company. (Can't find them now.)Since I paid alot to mail them, I just took it as a loss. Not worth the time and trouble to mail back. I would not recommend this stuff.
__label__2 File Under "Guilty Pleasures.": The 1980s were cheesy enough in terms of bad fashions, big hair, and Reganomics, but "80's Engergy" takes things to a whole new level. Johnny Budz compiles playfully tacky dance remakes of classic hits of the 1980s, and the result is a qualified guilty pleasure. Collage speeds up the tempo of George Michael's "Careless Whisper" and turns it into a Eurodance treat, while Goldfinger gives an underground trance makeover of the Human League's "Don't You Want Me." But a couple of these covers are hilariously bad. Moogue performs the most unusual act of cruelty by butchering David Bowie's "China Girl," and DJ Silver don't cover "Always On My Mind" nearly as well as Pet Shop Boys did in 1987. Still, "80's Energy" is fun enough to make you bring out the skinny tie, the "Flashdance" soundtrack, and that Atari 5200 that's collecting dust in your attic.
__label__1 Itty Bitty lasts itty bitty time: I have had both the original and the volume 2 book light. Both lights developed shorts in the wiring that cause the light to flicker --- very annoying. The light will not stay upright and flops down to the page. Have the same problem with both lights. I am looking for a new book light without an arm to flop or wires to bend.
__label__1 flash in the pan: I purchased this company's first book light and had many of the same problems that others have reported -- fast bulb burn up, shoddy connections and very high bulb replacement costs. This latest version suffers from the same.
__label__1 Not Itty Bitty: This item is anything but itty bitty. The actual light part appears sleak enough and will attach to your book etc., but there is a sencond part...the battery compartment, which requires four, count 'em, four "C" batteries. It apparently is supposed to sit on your lap or something. Very cumbersome.
__label__1 stopped working right away: I ordered this used.It looked pretty new when I received it.Within a week or so it stopped working.I sent it back.I ordered a brand new one this time.Have only used this one a few days.So far...so good.
__label__2 Robert Ross has the Chops: I have been a fan of Robert for over twenty years. I have seen him play in small clubs and back up such greats as Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. His lighting fast solos and great slide playing are truly amazing and he does all this and is as clean a player as I have ever seen. This first major release is a good effort by Robert with good original tunes and some fine covers. Robert has at last started to get the recognition he so long has deserved, play both the Chicago Blues Festival and the Montreal Jazz and Blues Festival this year. The CD is well worth a listen, but do your self a favor catch him live. You will be blown away.
__label__2 Handy and good value: With a wide door, this was a good find. Good value, sufficiently adjustable, looks good and functions well.
__label__1 Over the door Hook in Black: I'm not very happy with it because I wasn't aware that it was for a thick door and my door is not as thick so I had to adjust it but it doesn't look the way it's supposed to look. I feel that the seller should have stated that it was for a thick door.
__label__2 The Trial Book To Read: PRIDE BEFORE THE FALL relays the trials of Microsoft from a different point of view than Auletta's account. Heilemann's access to the key players, many of whom are unknown to the general public and received nary a headline, is just excellent. If you're going to read only one book about the Microsoft trials, this is it.
__label__1 whiny: This book is more of a whine session than an informative look into the microsoft case. Poor writing and questionable facts make this book impossible to read. Save your money!
__label__2 Great bird guide addition: I think this book is a great book for birders. It helped me learn birds by where I was (habitat), where in the past I had no real way of having core knowledge to build on for what birds I would see based on what type of habitat I was in (I'm not an expert birder). I've never seen another field guide done this way and I think it's a great way to catagorize birds.The pictures are great and the stories along with the identification info make this book a good read. I really enjoyed the Raven and Wolf story.I recommend birders add this book to their collection.
__label__2 Good product!: The Lennmar batteries are a good value. I find they are just as good as OEM batteries at a much reduced cost.
__label__1 Disappointment: I am so disappointed with this software. It crashes and seems to be extremely sluggish. I expected much better from a product that costs so much. I need to be able to create scripts for my clients, so I don't know what I'm going to do. But I may have no choice at some point to buy something else. I've got to get my work done and not have to constantly be frustrated with the way the software stumbles along.
__label__1 No. Just, no.: If you like seeing a camera taped to a rotating fan for 70% of the movie...Then this movie is for you. So many flaws also. It's 1988 and it looks to be filmed in HD. The overall setting looked to be in todays world. The first two sucked, so I shouldn't be surprised this one does too. It brings absolutely nothing new. Leaves unaswered questions that will probably wont get answered. The only thing that was good, was the littlest girls acting. Two stars just for her.
__label__1 SUCKS!!!!!!!: I hate all these extremely low budget scary movies that are filmed in a home-movie style with cheap camcorders. The scary parts of this movie mainly consist of loud bangs in the dark and household objects being thrown around. This feels like only half of a movie because the ending explains nothing. This movie is trash. Don't watch it.
__label__2 Do NOT open the door...: Being a fan of the first two movies, I had high hopes for this one. While I didn't find this to be the scariest of the bunch, it is still enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though, it definitely has it's scary moments (bloody mary scene anyone?). If you're like me, you thought you had a fairly good grasp of the story based on the first two films...this one just opens up a whole can of worms. The ending is relatively confusing and leaves a lot of questions unanswered...which leads into the inevitable sequel. Over all if you liked the first two, you'll probably like this one...and if you didn't like them then you'll probably hate it.
__label__2 Paranormal Activity 3: DIFFINATLEY a great addition to the franchise. The whole movie is utterly entertaining and followed an amazingly smart storyline. Has quite a few moments in witch the viewer will JUMP out of fear! The ending is also like the others leaving you with questions to be answers and needing a change of underwear. I highly recommend this movie and Conno pack especially if you liked the first two!!
__label__1 Very, very cheap quality: Sure this thing is only around $20, but this thing was built horribly. I had to snap the buttons back into the metal face plate as they were coming out from the factory. After a few times of switching button #1, it failed and wouldn't turn off. Another button stayed partially illuminated even when off. This is junk, stay away.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME: This is a horrible game, I mean it is just down right stupid. The fish are a real pain to catch and the line always snaps on the weakest fish when you are fishing. On top of that the game has the WORST music I have ever heard. The controls are odd and the graphics STINK. The worst part is trying to pick out the right bait to use. The are over 30 kind of bait and only one kind works for each fish. So the whole time you are trying to pick the right bait when the timer is going down. To get new levels you need to beat challenges which are impossible. You get WAY to little time catch a lot of really rare fish. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY BUY A BETTER GAME. !GOOD TIMES!
__label__2 teaching with the brain in mind: I was looking for a practical guide to use in teaching and the majority was practical.
__label__1 No Real Difference To Nails: Well, I've been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now. I've followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.I did notice that they seem more supple/flexible than before.I've also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go and though they aren't growing any father than usual, the tops do seem a bit smoother. Overall, not the best product if you're trying to grow sandal-worthy nails in a short period of time. It does seem like it would be nice for people with brittle, flaky nails, though!
__label__2 Wonderful!: Get it if you are even thinking about this! So versatile, beautiful, and comes in a set. What else can you ask for?
__label__2 Good not great: The quality is lacking with this set. The edges on the spoons are a little sharp. The major defect is that the spoon has a bur at the end. Blemishes are present on 2 other pieces. Ill keep them but no taste testing from these.
__label__2 The Best Sour Candy EVER!!!: I first ate this many years ago as a teen. It was the best sour candy I had ever had. By far better than the sour candy out there today. I bought some for my son for Xmas and he loves them. He has since passed them all out to his friends and now I'm on a new batch for him. You won't regret purchasing this candy.By the way, you don't want to eat the whole bag.It's not good for your tongue!LOL! And be prepared to watch people pucker and cry!
__label__1 An average song by an average band: This song is well tolerable. I am not a fan of the spice girls but i suppose if you are a fan that this song would most likely appeal to you as it is better than most of its predecessors
__label__2 Worth the time I spent searching!: I saw a mother using this when my son was only a couple of months old, and thought "Hey, that's cool". When it came time to find a solution to my son's inability to sit on his own in the grocery cart (he outgrew his car seat at 4 months), I had a hard time finding this. Finally, I met a woman with one, and she provided the manufacturer's name. I bought one, and plan to purchase them as gifts for all of the new parents I know. It's good to have early, because the baby will need it before you realize! We also use this in the high chair at our favorite restaurant. They have a decrepit old chair that I refer to as the "Chair of Death". This pad and strap make it work for our son though. I strongly suggest purchasing this and carrying it with you everywhere. It's quite portable and handy!
__label__2 Great seat for young children: I have used this seat extensively with my youngest daughter, now one, and have found it to be priceless at keeping her secure and safe from the yucky things one finds on shopping carts. I would highly recommend this to any new mom who prefers to use store shopping carts to keep their babies comfortable and safely seated.
__label__2 a must have!: This is a great item -- register for it -- you will need it as soon as your child is out of the infant carrier car seat! which my daughter was out of already at 4 mths (she's very long and outgrew the height requirement). The secure me travle seat works great -- it is easily adjustable and works in many situations (regular chairs, restaurant high chairs, carts, etc.)
__label__1 Not what I expected...: As a graphic artist, this book was a book about templates, and personally I have created and seen much better work than was featured here. This is the last book I buy from Mr. Green.
__label__1 Waterlilies by Monet-Mini folding umbrella: Product not as pictured...This umbrella was pictured and displayed as having bold, dark, deep colors of blue and green but in reality the colors turned out to be pastels(light blue and green rather than dark colors as displayed) and therefore not as stunning...Disappointed.
__label__1 Disappointing: I'd hoped I was investing in a useful book, esp. since one of the authors (Ismail) has coedited a book with Carver Mead. The material lacks conceptual clarity. It appears more like a compilation of material - a "cut and paste" effort by people who are strangers to analog circuits. I've met Terri Fiez at a conference - she was charming, but it was clear that she did not have a clean grasp of what she claimed was her area of expertise. Perhaps it was too much to expect Ismail to save this book ....
__label__2 Perfect fit: I bought these shoes before and they served me well for over a year. They fit well and needs very little break in. Very comfortable.
__label__1 Very disappointed: I was very disappointed with these shoes. This was the 3rd pair I order, 2 from another vendor and the last from Amazon. The first pair started to fall apart after several weeks. With the second pair, one of the shoes did not lay flat so it rocked when I stood in them. The last pair felt like it was a half size smaller than the other 2. It appears that quality control is lacking. Not what I expected for the price of these shoes.
__label__2 Feels pretty good out of the box: I bought these shoes because I wanted a decent quality shoe, but I also didn't want to pay an enormous sum. I paid $109, whereas the shoes are listed at $175 in the J and M catalogue. I only have to wear this type of shoe once or twice a week. At the same time, I wanted something that would be suitable for meetings with lawyers and courtroom testimony.I've had them for a very short period of time, but I'm pleased with them. They came quickly and were consistent with the advertisements and information about them. Though they are pretty stiff out of the box, they are not uncomfortable, which is a pleasant surprise. And they look great!
__label__2 Cannot go wrong with J&M: This is my second pair of Melton's. I have had the brown pair for 10 years with upkeep and resole every few years. These shoes are very stiff when new, but as they brake-in become great support for feet. The 3E width is perfect for an XW foot.
__label__1 horrific device!: i doubt this dictionary would have the word 'horrific'. wouldn't you think that the designer of a bookmark dictionary would realize that the market would be bookworms, that is, folks who have no need for every day words and a yen, an insatiable itch for that word just beyond reach? this was, therefore, one of the most frustrating purchases i have ever made, and i was frankly relieved when it failed to survive a rainstorm. by the by, one would also think that it would have survived a little rain. unless you have the vocabulary of an eight year old and the patience of a saint (and live in a desert) do not buy this product.
__label__1 NOT a WEBKINZ: I am upset because I wanted to purchase a Webkinz unicorn and this came up as a webkinz brand because it is tagged as such with Amazon. It is not Webkinz! It is Russ brand. You can go online with this in a manner similar to Webkinz but only on the Russ website. Cute unicorn, but not the one that my daughter had requested. I have also had difficulty returning to Amazon because although they managed to send me this request for a review, they don't seem to be able to find a record of my purchase so I can return it. Sign me very disappointed in Amazon for this one!
__label__1 Not vegetarian - contains gelatin: I searched for 'vegetarian candy' and this was one of the first results - gelatin is made from animal by-products.
__label__2 Struck gold!: In search of the original gummi bear from my youth, I struck gold on Amazon. Not only was a wide variety of the product(in terms of quantity and packaging) available, but pricing was quite reasonable. The 5-ounce bags work great as stocking stuffers and ancillary birthday gifts.
__label__1 Haribo: as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit "homesick", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the "original", much better.
__label__1 Not fresh.: These bears were not fresh at all. They actually were melted all together when I got them. I contacted Amazon and they promptly took care of the problem. I do not recommend this product but highly recommend Amazon.
__label__2 nice and sticky!!: First of all the color looks prettier in this picture. When it came it was indeed a beautiful, bright carribbean sea type blue, but with very little white washing through it (actually the reverse side--less sticky side--was prettier, ie more stripes...)so it would have been nicer had it been reversed. But it is still a pretty blue, although count on it being more solid blue than stripey like shown. I washed mine down with diluted dish soap on a rag and let it dry for an hour or so before using. I haven't worked up too much of a sweat on it yet but I did do challenging poses and experienced NO SLIPPING at all! So, overall the mat appears to be of good quality, grips the floor well--no sliding when I shift in poses, and my hands and feet didn't slip in any poses so far. I am going to keep up with the dish soap routine for a bit but it seems to be working out just fine for me! Would recommend it, don't stress over all the negative reviews, its a good price for a good mat :)
__label__2 night reader: so far the booklight is great. it is my fourth one. the cables are very sensitive, but it is still the best reading light at night.
__label__1 B is for...Blah?: This is the first Kinsey Millhone I've read, and given the success of the alphabet series it proved a great disappointment. A plot that is only mildly diverting, dialogue that is banal, narrative writing that is juvenile -- Example: Kinsey describing herself as "starving to death," by which she means...uh...hit by an attack of the munchies -- and imagery that is often pedestrian, sometimes obtuse, occasionally physically impossible. At one point Kinsey discusses the "concentric circles" she is making on a fine polished table with her cold drink. Nice image; nice, polysyllabic adjective, "concentric." Trouble is, unless the vessel containing the drink has a base that spontaneously contracts and expands, she couldn't make concentric circles with it. A single circle, sure; overlapping circles, maybe.A writer, then, in urgent need of a strong editor. Ah, but who dares second-guess a bestselling author?
__label__2 Better than A: The second in Sue Grafton's alphabet series really helps the series pick up speed. This one takes Kinsey from California to Boca Raton Florida and back.
__label__1 Nutranail Cuticle Remover: It doesn't seem to work well. I think it was a waste of one's money. I wouldn't purchase it again.
__label__2 Great cuticle remover: Decided to start doing my own manicures/pedicures versus having them done at a salon. This cuticle remover works pretty well and makes my manicures and pedicures much easier; with better results. I presoak before applying which seems to do the trick
__label__2 Halford is god!: I love this album for the pure power of the Metal God's voice. It was taken off the "Turbo Lover" tour, and the tracks "Rock you all around the World", and "Private Property" get the crowd riled up, and screaming the chorus back to Rob. But my absolute favorite Priest song is "Some Heads are Gonna Roll", and Halford screams the song out like no other. Only Bruce Dickenson can come close as far as screaming ability, and one only hopes that Halford and the boys patch things up, and give their fans a final world tour with the true Priest, and not "Steel Dragon". Rob Halford may be a bit strange, but as far as being a Metal singer, he is the very best out there, and to his hardcore fans he is was and will always be the true "Metal God".
__label__2 Millions of people worldwide need Renewable Energy Products: Wind Energy Products are available for : lighting, water pumping, refrigerating, communication... This book is a necessary reading for all persons wishing to give the alternative energies a chance. Complete with many addresses and inside knowledge. A must for the alternative energy enthusiast...
__label__2 Great Song: This contageous song can be played in my cd player all day. It has a punchy bass line, catchy organs, the sexy lyrics, and an alien sounding voice singing. Certainly a ground breaking song. I am disapointed in the sound of the remixes. I feel that they are stale. I love hearing them, because you can make out some of the voices more but over all i really dislike these remixes. For a ground breaking song, a ground breaking remix would have fit much better. These remixes sound very 1993.I also wish the slightly altered in sound video version was on here.But get in your car and BLAST the Radio Edit out of your stereo and you will feel it pump through your veins.
__label__2 Not much to say: Mechanix gloves are pretty much always a solid purchase. This is the third pair I've bought, and they've all been good quality, etc. They're not the most protective gloves in the world (for that, look for the impact-resistant version), but they're very good, and certainly help handle issues with heat, and lack of grip.
__label__2 Works great as a soft play area!: I purchased this toy for my 9 month old son. We have hardwood floors throughout our house and it works great as a soft play area. Due to his age, I didn't expect him to play with it as a puzzle or understand the letters. He does chew on the various pieces. I have to watch to make sure he doesn't bite any pieces off but so far it hasn't been any issue. He likes to pull it apart but it's so easy to put back together...it usually only takes a few minutes. I think it's a great activity for him and a good introduction to letters and puzzles. I also have dogs and I love this playmat because it can easily be wiped down and cleaned. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it.
__label__2 Nicely arranged compilation: This isn't a complete archive of their works. That would obviously be a boxed set. However, they have chosen a good collection of mixes here, mostly their own (hence indicated in another review that was unfortunately mostly negative). Chris Cox and Barry Harris like everyone else have gone through a subtle change of styles in the way they mix their different singles for artists. Their signature hard anthem sounds paved the way for their current trend towards power synths and hard tribal of today's singles like Thomas Newman's "Six Feet Under", which is just amazing (not included in this compilation, unfortunately). I've met both of these guys on separate occasions, just saw Barry again last week. As I am working on my own mixing at this point, it's nice to stay inspired by the talents of guys like this who have made today's sounds what they are -- and forging ahead the sound of dancefloor of the future. This enjoyable set is worth picking up.
__label__1 slow program and 3d bugs make it practically unusable: This is a very frustrating product - it is good in that it has a lot of features, however the major features seem to have bugs that make them almost unusable. Doors and walls disappear in the 3D view unless you "nudge" them around so that the program redraws, and even then it doesn't always do it correctly. I have spent more time on this program trying to get it to do what I want it to do, and it is extremely aggravating.I am using Windows XP with a 1.5Mhz Pentium IV processor and 512MB of RAM, so I don't think the speed problem is due to my computer, but just a problem inherent in the product. Viewing Punch's website support forum reveals frustrated users continually running against the limitations or outright flaws of the software.I don't know what other home design software to recommend, but not this one - there's just too many flaws for it to be worth the purchase price.
__label__1 poor new design: I purchased this to replace our older one. We have the same mat but was stained from red sauce. This new mat has different suction cups that do not work. So it fails to stay put.
__label__2 Nice, but only covers the divider: I was looking for a mat to go on both sides of the sink and also cover the middle. I did not know a mat was available for just the center, but that is exactly what this is.
__label__2 Wonderful: I walked into a small CD/DVD outfit in NYC since they had a good collection of funk and jazz in the window. I find the most interesting collections of music at places such as this, and I was welcome by the sound of this CD playing. The lounge electronica mix of classic and modern made me buy it immediately. Without a doubt - a fabulous 'chill' cd.
__label__2 Excellent resource: This book was an excellent resource for our two week vacation to Ecuador, including the Galapagos, in May of 2009. Lots of practical, helpful information.
__label__2 Alchemy Live is one of the best live recordings ever: What can I say except Mark Knopfler is at his best on this video. I don't think you will see a range in guitar styles and techniques on any other recording that could match Alchemy Live. Sultans of Swing, Tunnel of Love & the Opus Telegraph Road are among some of the best songs on this video and in the music industry overall. And best of all his songs actually tell a story and have meaning unlike a lot (not all) of the mundane pop songs that we hear today.
__label__1 Image quality much worse than VHS: I can't believe my eyes. Such an image should not be legal on a blu-ray. I don't think I have any VHS casette that is so bad. This Blu Ray only use is to listen to music with TV/projector turned off. I don't think it has more than 320 initial horizontal lines. What a shame !!!
__label__1 What a disappointment after 666.: Having only heard 666, I thought that a "Complete Collection" would yield lost treasures. How sad to find that Aphrodite's Child's early recordings were so bad. This disk reminds me of a "worst of the 60's" collection. The only redeeming factor are the ten cuts from 666.
__label__1 Kind of silly: While not utterly terrible, TE is a definate disappointment. The concept starts out as pretty cool but very quickly becomes borderline silly. The author struggles (unsucessefully) to find a meaningful story and the characters are flat and kind of juvenile (admittedly, they are young adults, but still...). One has to suspend a great deal of disbelief to stomach this book.I've never read Jack Williamson before and it is very unlikely that I ever will again.Not recommended.
__label__1 Unreliable product and company: Bought this product as well as a Derale fan, both of which have disappointed. Controller was defective and have waited 2 weeks for replacement. Derale is 6 hrs away, should have had it after 2 days. Overall, I spent too much money for marginal products, subpar tech support and horrible customer service. Out of the over 5K of upgrades I put into my truck and the 20+ parts supplies and manufactures, this is the worst. There are other product on the market, I for one will be going to the tried and true mechanical fan.
__label__2 Panasonic KX-FA132 cartridge for KX-F1000 series: Excellent service and delivery. I will order this item again from this seller through Amazon.com.
__label__1 These are not phonics - there are only beginning letters, not the...: ou words, nor any of the others - ie silent 'b' in climb for example, none of the inside phonics that give children the most problems. Any idiot can learn the abc's that start words! These are very very basic and hardly complete!
__label__1 no directions: bought this for hub for his ears. they tend to get wax build up. Rather than pay co-pays all of the time at the doctor,i bought this. The product didn't show up at first, i emailed the company and they sent another one. there are no directionson how to use it, hopefully we'll be able to figure it out when we need it
__label__2 Good To Catch Up On The Seasons: This product is a great way to get the first five and a half season on DVD. The CD zipper case which holds all the seasons is a good idea but some of the DVD's can get scratched; mine fortunately did not though. The ping pong set and poker set are a cute idea but I don't really play the games. I think this product is a bit overpriced for what you get. If you don't plan on using the Ping pong set or the poker set I would say just buy the DVD's individually.
__label__2 If you want to understand....: business statistics and at the same time learn how to use Excel statistical features, buy this book.Neufeld's emphasis is very much on using the power of Excel as a "tool" to convey an good understanding of the statistics. And having recently tried to brush up my Statistics using the traditional text book approach...So, if you're one of those who likes to really understand what's going on you'll like this book.
__label__2 PANASONIC RP-SD064 SDMI Memory Card - Great for Price: Ordered this item for my digital camcorder and it is very nice as an added extra to save pictures to when not using the recorder. Very small and compact for easy storage
__label__1 Not impressed: Not at all impressed with a carelessly put together book. Money is better spent elsewhere.
__label__1 Very cheaply made. I would not recommend this.: This item looks great in the photo, but when it arrived it was so badly made that I sent it back immediately. The bottom plastic part that is supposed to screw into the glass wouldn't sit properly or screw in correctly, so the metal part of the bottom also sat crookedly.The "copper" outside parts were cheap as well and looked like they would discolor immediately out in the elements. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
__label__1 Prone to rust: The beautiful copper finish lasted for a very short period of time. It was soon replaced by massive rust. It is difficult to clean and it also drips very easily. I would definitely not suggest this item.Again, copper plating prone to rust.
__label__2 Sharp Corner Protection: I ordered this item after seeing a similar one at a friend's house. Since my daughter was just starting to pull herself up on our coffee table I thought we needed the protection for head bumps. Using customer comments as a guide I purchased a small bumper for our 152" rectangular coffee table. It did not fit that shape. I wanted to exchange it for the medium size, but it arrived without a packing slip. By the time I received a copy nearly 25 days later it was to close to the 30 day return deadline and I was to tired from the hassle to exchange it, so I don't know how a size medium would have worked instead. I'm going to the fabric store to buy a leather needle and some sort of fabric to try to expand the bumper. The four stars are due to my liking the product, but feel some sort of dimensions are needed with the online description.
__label__1 DO YOU LIKE NOT HAVING A CHOICE?: Do you like being physically dominated by a man? Do you like being bound & naked continuously? Do you like having no say so over your own body? Do you like having all decisions made for you without being asked? If your answer is YES, then buy this book. If your answer is NO then don't.
__label__1 OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW: I am currently writing this review with an ice pack on my ear because of the major hand tools it takes to put this earring in. The ball that clasps on to the bottom of the earring is IMPOSSIBLE to put in when the earring is in your ear. I learned an important lesson today and will not be purchasing any product with this design again.
__label__2 Another great tale of crime in Southie: Great story that is easy to read about crime and corruption in South Boston. One criminal's take on his life and experiences. possible elaboration, but nothing seemed glorified.
__label__2 Enjoyable read with great characters: Peter was written at the forefront of the first novels featuring gay themes in positive ways. It has touching characterizations, people to pull for, and an ending that leaves you wanting more. What more could you want? Exotic locale? Its set in Australia and that comes through in the language and attitudes and is refreshing. It sets just the right tone for a 15 year old out to find his way. I enjoy the respectful way that the character David is handled as well, as a good person instead of the way many authors would have went just for shock value.
__label__2 This pad does its job well at a lower cost than others.: Okay - its a pad - not much to say about it; however, it is functional and inexpensive. We have had it for 9 months now and nothing has gotten through. That is most likely due to the fact that our daughter only had one accident - but it worked. That's what matters right! Buy 2 of these - keeping one ready for that inevetible for the middle-of-the-night emergency.
__label__1 It really really doesn't fit!: Ok, I just got done wrestling with this pad....I had high hopes and thought I would try it regardless of the reviews...IT REALLY DOESN'T FIT. I mean off by a long shot and I cannot even imagine the fit after it was washed. There are way too many pads to choose from to waste time, money and wrestling moves trying this one out.
__label__2 Love this!!!: I love this underwater camera case!!Three years ago I did some snorkeling in Hawaii and tried to take photos with those crappy disposable cameras. Out of two cameras, i had maybe 3 pictures come out.Last year I was on a cruise in the Caribbean and did more snorkeling only this time I had this housing for my digital camera. I got DOZENS of photos that just came out beautiful!!!I will never use one of those awful disposable underwater cameras ever again.
__label__1 Don't support this photographer: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that he is not an advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
__label__2 Powerful tool!: A powerful tool! I like it very much! As compare to Swiss Army Knife, the blade of Leatherman is more sharp and workable. The shear is somehow small, but it is not my main focus.
__label__2 An A for A&R: I've known Biill Flanagan over the years as a fellow traveler in music (we've written for a lot of the same magazines -- Musician, Rolling Stone, The NY Times, et al). I've always found him to be perceptive and clear-eyed about the music business while remaining a devoted fan of music, rarely cynical and unusually supportive, and those qualities serve him well in this novel. He's an engaging storyteller, and packs enough real adventure into the work--squalls at sea, a kidnapping, some street fights--to make me think that he could turn out some fine novels that have nothing to do with the music industry. But here he has great fun skewering the pretensions of the business while maintaining a genuine affection for his characters. Well done.
__label__2 Great designs for quaint, cute, unique and quick cross stitching: This book is well divided into categories and includes theme favorites, such as Christmas, holidays, flowers, hearts, alphabets, etc. The book also includes unique & fun designs within those and other categories: castles, dragons, carousel horses, frogs, Uncle Sam, state flowers, etc. Full color photographs of the finished designs precede by a page the full color design instructions. The designs can be used for small projects (bookmarks, jar toppers, etc.) or they can be combined to create larger projects.
__label__1 You get what you pay for ... cheap: I wouldn't recommend this product, just take a look at the price. Do you want to trust a cheap charger with your $300 MP3 player? I went to a more well know manufacture and bought a charger from them. Search Gomadic they are a more well known brand in Amazon and you will see better choices for example:Rapid Car / Auto Travel Charger w/ Tip Exchange for the Apple iPod Video (60GB) - Gomadic Brand
__label__1 wish i got the item: I have contacted amazon and the seller about not recieving the charger with the wall charge but no one cares amazon say contact buyer buyer says contact AMAZON and over 2 months have gone buy and no one has helped me and fixing the problem I will never buy from AMAZON AGAIN!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Por favor, ahorreselo: El dvd es muy malo tecnicamente, pusieron los canales al reves. Escuchara al publico adelante y el concierto atras. Ademas no es tan bueno como los videos Arriesgare la piel(Emi-Chile) y The best of (CGD-Warner).BAd, bery bad.
__label__2 good watch: As the last reviewer noted, there are some political undertones here. However, a 2 star rating is unfair. This video is a decent introduction to the Cuban environment and is worth the watch.
__label__2 Great CD!!!!: Love all the tracks, very happy and upbeat music. Also, I like the fact that they donate One-third of the artist royalties from the CD's sales to 'CARE' to help feed the hungry children throughout the world.
__label__2 One of my favorite books and a new favorite author: I love this novel. Read it! I discovered it by accident in a supermarket a few years ago and haven't forgotten it. Elizabeth Hand is a dazzling writer of unique vision, who transcends limitations of genre through her virtuosity with language. "Waking the Moon" remains my favorite of the Hand books that I've read. I eagerly await her next one.
__label__1 Pretentious and silly: This is a book for sensitive college girls who see faces in the moon. For the rest of us, though, this book is ridiculous. The use of mythology is interesting, but degenerates into laugh out loud scenes of bare-breasted women chanting and summoning snakes. Furthermore, Washington is a poor choice for a setting, since it is NOT an old city, even by North American standards.
__label__2 Perfect fit: My husband made a cradle for our son and when it came time to buy a sheet that fit it wasn't an easy task. I tried several stores in the area and I wasn't able to find one. Once I received the Koala Baby cradle sheet I was a little reluctant about whether or not it would fit. However, once I put it on the mattress, not only did it fit perfectly it was also very soft.
__label__1 Doesn't work with Toshiba Tecra A4 notebood: Same problem as reviewer B Chan - I have the USB wireless model, not bluetooth, but no response to extra programmable buttons on a Toshiba Tecra A4.Toshiba owners beware!!
__label__1 For Toshiba Notebooks - Test Before u Buy: Good build, feels comfortable and smooth wheel; no clicks - preference thing :)However not ideal for road warriors:1. No on/off switch..2. Dunno about other notebooks, but on a Tecra A4, P750, XP, SP2 with bulit in bluetooth (BT), BT security setting needs to be set to "low" (no security provided by bluetooth) before the mouse is recognized; in addition, if the setting is set to any level higher, the mouse will not be recognized again after a reboot. NOT SAFE!In addition even after installation of IP 5.2 software: side scroll wheel and page up/down buttons don't work (maybe conflict with notebook touchpad)It would be good to hear from other Tosh users out there. I am however returning the product.
__label__1 JVC Everio GZMG57 DIGITEL MEDIA CAMCORDER: With the camera recording and I turn my body I get a jerking motion on the play back. The biggest complaint I have is the lack of instructions that can be understood on how to do THINGS. Yes, I see a phone number. I can call and I have done this. When you get someone to help you which might be a long wait. They are very polite and explain so I can understand. Why can't they write instructions that can be understood in the first place. JVC is not alone on this subject
__label__1 Does More Harm Than Good: A poorly documented book that slams people, is filled with judgment, and does nothing to help others is the foundation of the entire book. Salerno's SHAM does not take into account the millions of people that ARE actually being helped. The book is filled with inconsistancy, poorly argued statements, and is an attack on celebrity, so that he, through this book, can cash in on the celebrity bashing.The whole book is filled with negative gossip, that while reading it, I wondered why I felt so bad? This book did nothing to help me, if anything, it made me feel worse.
__label__1 Terribly out of tune: I am a professional musician, so I might be overly sensitive to these things, but this keyboard is completely out of tune. I don't mean "it's not tuned exactly to A 440 concert pitch" I mean the notes are not in tune with each other. If you follow the "sheet music" included in this you get a minor rather than a major "Row, row, row your boat" and a "Twinkle Twinkle" with a minor sixth instead of a major one. It's nice that they attempt to have a complete octave, but if all you have are eight notes they'd better be the eight notes of the major scale!Not usable in my opinion.I can't speak to the durability or other usability issues mentioned in other reviews because we didn't even take it out of the box and are sending it back.
__label__2 Works great and very durable: This bracket is very strong.I use it every day at work with a 15 inch point of sale system that's about 40+lbs.Very sturdy and easy to adjust.It can be attached to just one stud.
__label__2 Great Book: This is one of the best books I have ever read on Tibetan culture and religion. It is clear and concise. It is extremely informative, revealing practices that have been kept secret, for some unknown reason, for centuries. A great book!
__label__1 Not as I thought it would be.: I ordered this book for my grandchildren. The age it is stated to be intended for is not appropriate. The words are confusing and way above the learning stage of the intended age group.
__label__2 AUSSIE THUMBS UP FROM COUNTRY MUSIC LOVER: A texan friend told me of these guys and I think they are fantastic. It's like true country meets heavy rock. They write about real issues and keep in down to earth. I'll be buying their other CD's for sure and telling all my Aussie friends about them. These guys are what country music is all about!!
__label__2 Good music: Progessive country with a flare of rock. Each song is enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this album as a good buy,
__label__1 Not for home studios, not worth $100: I am planning a home studio approx. 12X15 (180sf) in space. This book on building a ceramic studio is a lovely overview and picture book of several professional studios in southern climes, which I am not in and ranged size from 375sf to 5,000sf. Also, it was advertised on Amazon.com as retailing for $144.67, but I bought a used copy for $29.00 and feeling pretty good about the savings. It is printed right on the interior of the book jacket that the publisher's retail price is $24.95.This is not a critique of the contents of the book. But when I thought it was a $100 value, I assumed I was getting THE bible of home studios. Instead: the pictures were lovely, the info for professional artists planning a studio and showroom are probably good, but anyone at that level of the craft probably already knew alot of the info. And it was definitely not worth more than the original retail. Not too relevant for a home potter in New England.
__label__1 blah.: It isn't as good as The Twilight Zone. very outdated. very corny. The hour long format is boring. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
__label__1 Cheaply made DVDs or what?: I sent the first DVD back because it kept stopping in the middle of scenes and getting stuck. After receiving the replacement DVD, it worked fine but then started doing the same thing. I think when mass duplicating these DVDs they must write them at very high speeds which may corrupt a few, or many for that fact. I've tried it in other DVD players and it does the same thing. My other DVDs work just fine. I think these must have been cheaply made (probably in Mexico like the Brady Bunch DVDs). I will not buy any more Outer Limits DVDs. Very disappointed.
__label__2 Barefoot in the Park: Very well written.Superb for community theatre productions.Has all the characters that makes for a good tryout and production.This should be on the list for any community theatre.
__label__2 Christopher Walken is classic!: Light farce. Fun. Cast is terrific. No more to say but nine more words are required. So see it. Done
__label__2 Good For Kids: I think that Barney the purple dinosaur is a good role model for children 12-24 months.He teaches kids about hygiene, and how to treat each-other,etc.
__label__1 Not for me.: Barney's Chirstmas Star is one of the most boring movies I'veever watched.I had to watch it with my child and I could notsit through it. I know Barney is a very good movie/show foryoung children and is very educational,but I'm not going to watchit again.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: I bought 2 of them for my Mac Minis: one for home and one for work. Unfortunately, the scroll down button broke 4 months later on both mice. I take great care of my belongings and keep my computer equipment clean and in a dust-free environment. Macally products are usually great and the mouse itself is fine if it wasn't for this glitch.
__label__2 Aura Spa Lavendar Shampoo: This is an excellent product. It is the only one that works with my hair and unfortunately, I can only find it online anymore. I have waist length hair and all I need is a dime-sized amount of this shampoo. It lathers wonderfully and leaves my hair in great shape, and it smells great too!
__label__1 romantic sound: This has a "romantic sound" and I was looking for something more relaxing. If your looking for something more relaxing, I'd recommend "Passages" by Mike Wall.
__label__2 Glad to go lighter!: We recently purchased this product to replace a heavier, bulkier wheelchair we had been using for general transport. It has been a backsaver for me...it is lighter all around (from lifting it in/out of the car to pushing my 200+lb husband) plus it stores in smaller places than our previous one.I'm not sure why I waited so long to replace our other one!TIP: BE SURE to put those brakes on the back wheels before loading your rider...it does have a tendency to tip back if you don't.
__label__1 Returned Item: This product had to be returned because it did not fit nor did it solve the problem for which it was ordered. The company was honest and credited our account. I would deal with them again.
__label__2 Hey, it's still George Jones: This modestly-programmed collection is a good overview of his final work for the MCA label from 1991-98. The disc opens with Jones struggling to feign interest in the rock-oriented "young country" sound; the problem was with the formula, not with his singing, which remains great to this day. There are some notable songs, such as "Wrong Is What I Do Best," but where things really started to click is on "High-Tech Redneck" and "Walls Can Fall," songs that marked the start of a commercial and creative renaissance that finally got George engaged on an emotional level again. This may be about as much of his music from the period as most folks would need, although diehard fans will also want to track down the original albums.
__label__1 Premium Price - Poor Craftsmanship: Wherein this was a quality filter for my Nikon 18-200 lens, after two weeks, the glass fell out of the rim. Just fell out while changing filters. What was an important component to my photography, and camera protection, is now an expensive piece of trash. As a replacement, I went with a different brand. I guess when the packaging says, "professional filter series," it means that "professionals" have enough money to purchase replacements when their equipment goes prematurely south. I can only hope my filter was a fluke and Quantaray does not have serious quality control issues. But like I said, it was a nice filter when it was in one piece.
__label__2 Good. As described: I bought it because the great reviews from other user. I brought it to a trip to Mali, nothing went wrong, views are good. Satisfied with what I got.
__label__2 Excellent buy for the money: This is a very nice little,lightweight binocular. It draws in things crisp and clear. It's perfect for sporting events, travel, and musicals. I have a more expensive, heavier pair, but I always grab this one since its light and easily fits in a coat pocket. I originally bought one for my daughter to take to high school football games, but when I saw and tried it out, I bought myself one. It has separate adjustments for each eye if you need it.
__label__1 really pathetic: WHY OH WHY do we make romantic images out of what the ancient egyptians actually accomplished? Grossly and highly exagerated claims about them are taught as FACT in area schools and Mr. Poe seems to be adding fuel to this fire. We leave in a society that takes the word of journalists and actors over people trained in their respective fields. it truly is pathetic. we need to stop believing that the ancient Egyptians speak with this magical voice that we have forgotten. Because as far as hard evidence can tell us, they didn't. I mean, in 6,000 years they couldn't figure out the importance of the brain!!!They picked it out through the nose when you were embalmed because they didn't feel it was worth anything. For the record, I'm from Memphis Egypt and I have blue eyes.
__label__2 egyptians: I read this book and it is really interesting.If egyptian aren't black then why does egyptian presedent Anwar Sudat looks african. People sometime mistake me for egyptian but i'm black and dark. beacause all black people don't have wooly hair or real dark skin. so egyptians had to be black. think about it?
__label__1 Complete hogwash: Throughout history Blacks have served only two purposes: slave labor and amusing others. This book falls in the latter category.
__label__1 These are not worth even one star!: These are not like the ones we use to buy. They are thin and flimsy. I had to scrunch it up and put a rubber band around it to even get it to be of any use. I will try to put two of them together to have a least one that is halfway useful. If I were SOS I would be ashamed to put my name on them. The old ones were so good and these are total crap!!!!! I would not advise anyone to buy them. the worst part is I bought a pack of 24.
__label__2 Tuffy Dishwashing Pad: I find that these are the best scrubbers for most kitchen clean-up. Unlike regular S.O.S. pads these are made of plastic and do not scratch pans. I was unable to find them in stores so I got them from Amazon. Great little product. My only criticism is that you have to be a bit careful so they don't unravel. They last a long time and are simple to clean in the dishwasher, if necessary.
__label__1 Returned due to terrible quality: Like some of the other recent reviews, the quality of these blue scrubbies is terrible. I returned this item to Amazon as they are virtually unusable. I can't imagine these would last through more than one or two dish washes. Purchase them if you don't believe it or think that we are being overly critical (which is what I thought prior to ordering)... but be prepared to return them once you see for yourself. They may look like what you expect them to based on the pictures, but the reality is that they are not up to any reasonable standards for this type of product.
__label__1 Don't Buy These: I tried to order the original red and yellow Tuffies, but they're out, maybe permanently. These blue ones are bogus; they are flimsy. You may as well buy whatever scrubbers they're selling at the grocery. Another fine product bites the dust.
__label__1 New Blue Tuffy much lower quality: Beware the new blue Tuffys. I just tried to buy the usual red and yellow Tuffy and all they had was this new blue one. I could tell as soon as I picked it up off the shelf that it was a crappy, cheap version of what used to be a decent product. I have gone out of my way to pay more money for the yellow and red Tuffy's because the cheaper copies just didn't last as long, or feel as good in my hand.The manufacturer is insulting me by thinking that I won't notice the much lesser quality of this blue Tuffy. It is thinner and losely connected. I expect it to fall apart very quickly.
__label__2 The Art of Writing Essays: As he is often wont, Wendell Berry speaks to both young and old in this excellent collection of essays in which he wrestles with some of the most important questions American citizens ought to be pondering today. The opening essay, "A Citizen's Response," sets the very constructive tone of the entire collection--a collection which ends with a theme familiar to those who frequent Berry's ideas: "Is Life a Miracle."
__label__2 A must read!: It is difficult to write a review for a book that is so well written, so unbelievably relevant and important, that makes you feel humble as you try to form a clear concise sentence the way only Wendell Berry can. He is our modern day Mark Twain! Thank you, Mr. Berry, for saying what needs to be said!
__label__1 Picture is deceiving: Do not buy this product if you think you are getting a pad that looks like the picture. It has a completely different look to it than whats in the picture. Charcoal Gray??? Ha!!!! more like Disco Silver!!!!!!
__label__2 gimme more: sour s'ghetti will keep you wanting more. before you know it, you will have finished your bag and be craving another handful of yummy gummies. def worth to order multiple bags.
__label__2 short, but beautifull: No voice on this album, just his great piano playing, and some additional whisteling. The album is hauntingly beautifull, but terribly short - it only lasts about 20 minutes. It's a kind of Brad Mehldau meets minimalism album; it might sound very simplistic, it still is beautifull enough to blow you away. If it would be a bit longer, it would be a five star album for sure.
__label__1 Absolutely horrible quality: I understand that alot of people love Michael Jackson including myself. That is why I was suckered into buying this DVD. I usually do not return items but I just had to do it. This is SUCH a waste of money. No matter how desperate you may be to add unseen footage of MJ to your collection do not buy this. It's nothing new. Also, it is the worst quality product I have ever bought in my entire life. I understand that people want to jump on the bandwagon and try to make a quick buck off of MJ fans like me but this is just ridiculous. Have you no shame win productions. Seriously.
__label__1 desilusionado: la verdad pense encontrarme con mejor imagen de la que vi tanto en la primera como en la segunda parte... parece que lo hubieran bajado de internet y tiene muy mala calidad para el precio que tiene.
__label__1 Disapointed fit and finish: First of all, this item is shipped as freight, so delivery is not via the UPS guy like most of my Amazon products.Secondly, some of the pieces were labled wrong. The seat had a sticker on it (Back) that was clearly in the front by the illustration--and the only way it would fit together. The major assembly is by Tenon and dowels, which is fine, but impossible to take apart to replace or re-asseble (see next point).Finally, one of the pre-assembled joints was poor and I had to use glue to keep it together. All-in all, I don't recommend this product.
__label__2 Please don't believe the previous reviewer...: I felt I should make a contribution in order to up the average rating of this record. This record is absolutely sublime, transcendently cool, jazz-inflected house, perfectly mixed and produced with amazing subtlety, and basically all-round wonderful. Please don't believe the last reviewer: he or she has been listening to too many Prodigy records.
__label__1 CO2 tank empty, and crappy mask: Really good marker but the CO2 tank was empty and the hopper is cracked and the mask is a throwaway. Should'nt show things you are going to send bad or wrong.
__label__1 Kipper-Let it Snow: this was the cheapest VHS I've ever ordered. First..it took MONTHS to come and then it was as if EACH story was spliced unto a blank tape. EACH story had the ENDING credits and then it started the next story. It was ONLY 30 minutes long. I saw this SAME tape at [a store] and it was 60 MINUTES long. Bad, bad taping...could have done it myself
__label__2 Kitchen Aid Slow Cooker: Great product with wonderful controls. My old slow cooker kept cooking the food even though it was supposed to be on warm only! My only 'complaint' is that I wish it were a little smaller in size. 7 quarts is VERY large. Great for soups but too big for many things I want to do and it simply takes up alot of storage space in my kitchen
__label__1 So disappointed with KitchenAid: Purchased slow cooker through Amazon.com on November 10.1st crock was chipped, used it anyway and found it leaked also (crack I couldn't see).Amazon quickly sent replacement. 2nd crock is warped and lid (1st or 2nd) does not fit properly - major gap.Ordered a replacement again ... response from Amazon"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are unable to send another replacement.We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."We are SOOOOO disappointed with KitchenAid. (Amazon has been VERY responsive, as always!)
__label__2 excellent product: I don't know of any other slow cooker on the market (with the exception of maybe the AllClad) that has as much temperature and timing flexibility (10 hours with an extra 4 of warming time), with simple styling that would fit in with any kitchen. With the 7 quart capacity, whole chickens and a whole lot of ribs fit nicely. I have not found 7 quart liner bags of yet, but you can work with the 6.5 ones. It's solidly constructed, as opposed to some of the cheaper brands, and it works wonderfully.
__label__1 Wrong item sent: As described, I ordered a "hand winch with cable", however; upon arrival I received a hand winch with a strap (not a cable which is needed for my pulley system) which does not or will not meet my needs. When I complained to the shipper there was no response. Since it cost too much to return I just threw it on the shelf with the other junk.
__label__2 Great price: For the price, it is great. The latch is a little "iffy", but it's fine for my uses. Don't think I would trust it with 1200 lbs, though.
__label__1 Thought I would save money: I bought this to save money on batteries, only it doesnt work all the time, so I ended up having use batteries anyway now.
__label__1 NOT for Model PT-550: Advertising needs clarification: I've searched high and low for a few years now for a power adapter for the P-Touch PT-550. The advertisement led me to believe this might finally work. It doesn't. The PT-550 takes a 9.5 volt adapter, and it's VERY finicky about any variations in voltage. 9.0 won't work, nor will anything above 9.5.No variable voltage wall wort I've found will put out a 9.5 volt AC either. The PT-550 sucks batteries quickly. If you're going to get an older model P-Touch, stay far away from the 550 (although it functions well other than the power issues), and DON'T buy this power adapter for your existing 550.
__label__2 Superb: I rarely review items for Amazon, prefering to leave that to others. This production is, however, of such high quality I feel it deserves all the recognition it can get.Staging is sparse, but appropriate and meaningful to the flow of the story line. Costumes are not necessarily modern, but certainly not 'period correct'. They are very striking though, and lend brilliance to the effect.The singing is spectacular from all the characters.Musical direction is first rate. Most of all, the sound and picture quality in Bluray is magnificent.This is , for my money, the best available version of 'Lohingrin" available. Wagner's work is allowed to speak for itself, without imposition of any outside agendas. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Wonderful gift for dog-lovers: I got this as a gift for a friend who loves dogs and they thought it was wonderful! It's got tons of gorgeous pictures - even if you are not necessarily a dog person you will enjoy the skill it took to create such beautiful images.
__label__1 Poor quality - poor customer service: I purchased this battery for my Dell computer. It failed within a few months and they sent me a replacement (after numerous efforts to reach them went unanswered). That battery failed within a few weeks. They promised a refund when we sent that one back but instead they sent another battery! That one also failed immediately. We sent that one back and they claimed they never received it. So, they refused to refund, replace or give us any credit for the purchase. I paid them $80 dollars for a battery I don't have after 3 of theirs failed. I paid for return shipping, so I lost more than the original cost. My repeated efforts to get the owner to contact me were ignored and refused. Poor quality and horrible customer service.
__label__1 Breaks Easily: I bought two of these for my Dad (one for the walker and one for the wheelchair). It didn't fit on his first walker (very basic hospital type walker). The frame was too small for the cup alone, and too big to use the adapter. He later got a HUGO walker and it did fit that one fine. The down side is that it breaks very easily! I am frequently lifting my Dad's walker and putting it in the trunk of the car, and it is very easy to break the plastic drink cup holder. (The second drink cup holder got broken when we checked the walker with the airline, and I suppose I should have seen that one coming). Otherwise, they worked fine for the short time we had them.
__label__1 Similar to Hinge Factor: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I purchased the Hinge Factor, this author's previous attempt to explain the outcome of events on external factors, and found it to be both poorly written and historically inaccurate. It was a badly executed work, although it was an interesting concept. Notwithstanding this, I ended up buying this book to see if, perhaps, better editing had resulted in a better product.Sadly, the answer is no. This book is, once again, contains numerous writing errors (it is quite clear that this author's primary language in not English, and either this is a bad translation, or was not subject to proper editing) and confusing fact and fiction. Another failed effort. Perhaps not as disappointing as the Hinge Factor, but still really not worth ones time and effort. Sorry.
__label__2 Wonderful book: This book was such a great help to my husband and me. We didn't completely realize what we were doing to hurt each other - or maybe we did, but it became so habitual that neither of us knew how to break it. This book helped so much in teaching each of us what our weaknesses were and what to do to improve them.I saw some of the reviews saying the book only had very obvious advice. Most of it IS obvious, like don't be disrespectful and show anger. I knew that, of course, but the problem was, it was a habit. We didn't know HOW to overcome it. That is how the book helped us most. Teaching us how to communicate in ways that are not hurtful. I highly recommend it for anyone in a bad marriage.I do not know if it would be very helpful for couples who already have a good marriage but are looking to improve. I feel like this book is aimed toward couples who are REALLY struggling. It's worth a look though, if you're not sure, check it out at the library and see what you think.
__label__2 I love the Jefferson's: The Jefferson's First Season is great and Funny but you really have to watched the All in the family because is the spend off of it
__label__2 It gets no better then this!: I had no idea this was a spinoff from all in the family until i picked up, AITF! This shows the bomb! Bomb as in good. It's all new to me, i was a baby in early 80's!! This shows very funny. Moving on up yall!! I like George though, he got major swag! Enjoy this, because i am.
__label__2 I am beginning to get worried weather Jeffersons season 5 will be released. someone please help: I am getting worried about weather The Jeffersons the complete Fifth Season is going to be released anytime soon. I guess it will be another long awaited release. someone please help with any information. thanks. anyway, The Jeffersons first season is excellently funny.
__label__2 Todd, no sensitive love songs...: This is a great record, especially the songs "Just in Case" (decidedly not a sensitive love song), 'Happy to be Here" and especially "D.B. Cooper". The use of a horn section in the arrangements of some of the songs is quite clever and makes me chuckle -- something that I look for in a Todd Snider recording. He continues to be one of our best troubadours in the Woody Guthrie sense of the term. Well worth getting.
__label__1 A Master of Inclusion and Exclusion: Irving took me in once. I gave GORING a good review on the face of what seemed to be in depth research, and overlooked that which was left unsaid. Having now read GOEBBELS, I understand his methodology. He includes enough to reel in the unwary, but leaves out or glosses over that information which would indict the guilty. This book is a perfect example of that technique. Irving uses it, as he did GORING, to infer that Hitler, and most of the German military and civilian population, just weren't aware of the atrocities at the concentration camps.Shame on you, David Irving!
__label__1 its fiction, not history: Unfortunately, this interesting bit of history relies on fictional details to support its larger claims. There is documentation about the falsities in this volume that came to light at David Irvings libel trial in London that removes any value to this book other than the interesting and fascinating way that Mr. Irving is able to weave his stories. If you like other WWII fiction you might enjoy this. If you are looking for REAL history then you are better off reading Goebbels diary entries in their original German than relying on David Irvings misguided attempt to channel the Third Reichs thinkers in this book.
__label__1 Not a very good idea Paul: I grew up listening to the Beatles and older country. I have a lot of respect for the oldies but goodies because if it was not for them, we would not have rock and roll today. But when I heard the samples for this album, I couldn't believe my ears. I feel Swing should stay where it is. Do not take Rock Songs(current ones-within the last 20 yrs) and turn them into swing. It doesn't sound right. There are plenty of songs from that era that sound great to swing. Like New York, New York by Frank Sinatra. I listen to all kinds of music...it just depends on my mood. But this is only my opinion.
__label__1 Great - when it works.: This was actually my second iRobot Roomba. The first one, the basic red model, just started stopping and starting and only going in small circles and shutting off, after we had only had it for about one-and-a-half months, just after the "return" date, of course. We bought it at Circuit City, who claims they fix all the products, but found out everything BUT Roomba products,which should have been my first clue. I ordered this one from Amazon, hoping I had just gotten a lemon. Once again, after about one-and-a-half months, it began appearing to charge; but after I turned it on, charge light would go back to red, like it hadn't been charged. I'm hoping Amazon will treat their customers better than Circuit City and either repair or refund. Not buying another Roomba though! Hoping the Sharper Image one is better. We have mostly hardwood floors too, so not like it was a difficult job.
__label__1 Just not worth it: We've had ours for over a year. At first I thought it was going to be very useful, but it has turned out to be more of a frustration than a useful device. It does very poorly on carpeted areas, and the front wheel gets bogged down with pet hair very quickly on any type of surface. You can't clean the front wheel as it doesn't detach, so your only option is to use a pair of tweezers on it. I found myself spending more time on cleaning the Roomba than using it. We quickly stopped using it for cleaning rooms and just use it for cleaning under the bed, where our vacuum will not fit. Today, it has decided to stop working after a few seconds of use, so I'm guessing it is the battery, although it shows having a full charge. Good luck in trying to get their Tech support to assist either on the phone or via email.
__label__2 Wonderful: I throughly enjoyed reading "Time Will Tell". Friendship is something we seem to forget about once we 'grow-up', graduate from highschool and/or college, get married, etc. Sina, Rachel, and Hope had a lock on their friendship no key could unlatch. Over a ten year time span, no matter what obstacles were thrown their way, their friendship was able to endure it all. It makes me look back on my friends and how time and other obligations have pushed us apart. Throughout the story, their strong belief in God was often mentioned which made the story more authentic. There are certain events that took place at the end of the story that makes me anxiously await a sequel. Keep on writing Trevy!
__label__2 Very nice!: Bake cookies, biscuits... whatever, and the cookie pan cleans up easily. It's a nice size - not too large or small.
__label__1 Loss of sustain: No signal interruptions (which is a good thing), but there is A LOT of an annoying loss of sustain. I play mainly classic hard rock songs and I really felt a lack of a more consistent sound. I'll try to compensate it with a compressor pedal before the pedalboard, but I dont know if it will be effective. If it don't works, I'll try to sell the product (warning about the sustain issue, surely).Don't ask me why, but when I was looking for reviews in order to decide what wireless system to buy, i found very good ones for this product. But just when I got and tested it, I returned to google adding the word SUSTAIN to the search and finally found a lot of bad reviews, all them reporting this terrible issue.So, here's another bad review :/
__label__2 5 piece oak dining set: Itg makes a nice set once you put it together. The instructions leave it up to the customer to figure out how to get the chair slats into the holes in the seat. You have to twist them into the holes which requires some force. That was the hardest part of the whole operation. The rest was easy.
__label__1 SCAM DVD!!! DO NOT BUY!!!: So I bought this DVD with the idea that it would be like other orchestral videos where cameras pan the orchestra, conductor, etc... NOT SO - this is a total scam DVD - basically no different than a CD. Each movement track has a boring still picture that lasts the entire movement without change - and to top it off it's a very unimaginative performance... Of course because I have opened it I am probably not allowed to return it either - if that is the case, thank God I'm only out about $12... Unfortunately at this time there does not seem to exist a DVD of an orchestra playing the famous music of Ferde Grofe. I have a feeling that the other Naxos DVD's are made in this way too - be careful before buying a DVD from Naxos - they need to advertise much clearer. A fine recording of this work can be found in the CBS Masterworks CD recording with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Phil.
__label__2 best gummi peaches ever: i love candy, and i love haribo, these gummi peaches give me a sense of nostalgia and are easily my favorite...i highly recommend these...
__label__2 Decca "Not-As-Legendary" as...: Kertesz's Requiem doesn't have the magic and magisterial qualities as the Ancerl version on DG does but nevertheless it is a very good performace. Kertesz plays it balanced, but not as vigorously and energetically as Ancerl does. The Decca sound is demonstration quality as the DG is.It's true though that Kertesz was totally in tune with the world of Dvorak, as his excellent Symphony cycle shows...but still, Ancerl reins when it comes to the Requiem!
__label__2 One of my favorite movies: So glad I could find it in DVD. Perfect condition. Love the extras. What can you say about a perfect product, great seller, super fast seller, great price. All good. No that's wrong..........GREAT everything!!!!
__label__2 Love It1: I just love Valerie Bertinelli. This movie is a must see. A fun romantic family movie, you will enjoy it.
__label__1 Bad purchase: We purchased this inflatable mattress in March 2011 and used it for one visit from the grandkids (4 nights) in April. In August we got it out again and our grandson woke up on a flat floor. The mattress had deflated. We tried again; same ending.We have tried to find the leak using water, soapy water - doing everything the Intex site said to try. We finally ordered a new valve so the mattress would work for the next visit. It deflated again even with the new valve. We are very unhappy with this purchase.
__label__2 Quality product: I use this mattress for camping. For the price, it can not be beat. I am 215 lbs and I lost no air in the mattress for the first two days, then just a little on day three. I would have no hesitation buying this over its competitors.
__label__1 I took my chances...: I had pretty low expectations and I wasn't dissappointed. It never inflated all of the way for reasons I couldn't fiqure out. The pump that comes with it has such a low pressure of air coming out I felt like I could have blown it up faster. I laid around on it for an evening and it was okay, though I was afraid to move to much for fear of it would just collapse under my weight (which is just 118). I actually purchased it for overnight guests on Xmas but suspect that after a 250lb man spends the night on it, it won't last very long. But in the products' defense I got what I paid for and I knew that going in.
__label__2 Perfect for what we need: We ordered two of these airbeds. I gave it four stars because the second one had a leak, which we didn't discover until my daughter slept directly on the floor! I returned it (very easy process) and received a replacement very quickly (no leaks!). Easy to inflate and deflate, I think this product is well worth the money!
__label__1 Leaked air-- was unuseable: I pumped this mattress up and it leaked a considerable amount of air within 1 hour, I also have a Coleman mattress and it holds air and is a lot thicker construction. Don't buy this one.
__label__1 Battery-powered pump doesn't work.: I see a couple of bad reviews about this product, but I find it fascinating that no one has complained about the fact that the battery-powered air pump is complete trash. It is as if I bought a toy version of it. I admit that the mattress looks really nice, and probably feels good to sleep on AFTER it is fully inflated, but what freaking good is it if the pump doesn't work? To make matters worse, I tried putting the damned thing back inside the box to return it, but the damned thing doesn't even fit back inside! By the time it is inside the box, there is no room to put the pump, and the box looks like it is about to explode.IMO, (even if for a measly $20), this product is NOT worth getting.
__label__2 Sony Skymap 2000: Great product. I mounted the antenna in every place possible in my Tahoe and it worked no matter where it was located. Great user freindly software gives you real time accident reporting (Depending on your location). I would recommend this hardware software combination to anyone who wants a GPS solution for their car.
__label__1 Hope you own a battery store: This is a really nice radio, But, It eats batterys and there is no recharger for it. Stay away from this unit unless it is going to sit and never get used.
__label__2 Good value: Range is as stated on open land but batteries do tend to lose a lot of power quickly. A handy little unit.
__label__1 I paid but never received this item -- BEWARE!!!!: I placed my order on March 7 and I am still waiting for it to arrive.
__label__1 don't waste your money: Do not waste your money buying this item. I tested it on various glass surfaces and it did not perform well, it didn't even puncture skin.
__label__2 Great invention: So much better than trying to find that hammer version. It's a glass breaker and seat belt cutter all in one. Got one for me and one for my mother.
__label__1 it doesnt work: how can it save life if one of them doesnt work?it's a gift. i am pretty disappointed about this product.
__label__2 Miles Davis, Young, but still great!: I bought this yesterday from a local record store and wow. Man is it good. It isn't hs greatest stuff because he was younger and less experienced but it is still absolutely great.
__label__1 Service/Support lacking: This vacuum worked great the first few weeks, did a good job cleaning, was able to get under furniture, and was very quiet and unobstrusive. Then problems started. It ran but wouldn't pick up debris and it seemed like the brushes weren't working. I noticed the end caps had disappeared. The company sent replacement ones for free but this didn't fix problem. Now I can't get customer support on the phone despite waiting extensive stretches on hold, and e-mail support is not reponding. Can't find where to get warranty work done. So vacuum has been inoperable for a couple months. Had to break out the old upright.
__label__2 Very happy customer: A person with a heavy vacuum cleaner could do a better job in the same amount of time. However a person with a heavy vacuum cleaner is not going to sweep my apartment every day for an hour. Roomba will, and the result is that the floor is much cleaner. I run it every morning while I am getting ready for work and have had no problems with it.
__label__2 Roomba Rocks: I have two cats and this is great to pick up cat hair. It goes all over on its own for about an hour. It knows where the steps are and a remote enables me to block off other areas. I use it every day and it is amazing how much it picks up.
__label__1 Do Not Buy This Product!: I purchased this cleaner a year ago to use for my office floor...just about a 16 by 20 area. It has never made it around the room yet. It gets stuck, unravels the carpet and tries to suck it up (and gets stuck), gets stuck in the corner. Awful product. I was going to send it back to the manufacturer but figured they'd resell it so I scraped that idea. I am 56 years old and have made many, many purchases over the years. This is the worst product I've ever bought. I feel truly ripped off. Do Not BUY!
__label__1 Work only for 1 year: I got this last Christmas of 2004 and it die exactly around Christmas of 2005. So I wouldn't consisder this to be a product but more as a toy to have. To be honest I only use this no more that once every 2 week. So after about 26 uses it die. Well, not exactly dead, but it started doing circle and stop every 15 seconds.I never like to write review for a product because it waste my time, but for such a bad product I have to.
__label__1 They only last...maybe a year.: I received the red roobma several years ago and I loved it. I'm a stay at home mother and thought this thing saved my life! After about a year it started acting funny. It would turn in a couple of circles then stop. So last year after IRobot came out with their latest and greatest, I bought one. It was the black scheduler for $329. Not quite a year later it started doing the same thing. I called their customer service and they said the sensors around the wheels were dirty and needed blowing out with a can of air. I did that and it did not help. I sent it back and bought a rechargable hand vac.I'd really be interested to see what all these people have to say about their roomba after 1 year.
__label__2 pretty cool.: The Roomba works. I have two cats and it picks up the cat hair that gets everywhere everyday. I used to use a handheld vacuum everyday but now I press clean and I can run errands or knit or learn how to play the piano. It can get annoying to pick up cords everyday, so I figured out a way to remove them. I clean the filter everyday, and I was really surprised to see how much cat hair it picked up. I still vacuum my couch to remove pet hair weekly but people have mentioned that my floors look cleaner than they ever have before. Clean regularly andit works.
__label__2 Watch out dirt and dust !: I've seen the commercials, I've read the reviews and got it with my 1-click ! I do mostly all my christmas shopping for the kids on Amazon and decided this year it was time for MY gift.It has been almost a month and so far I can't say anything negative about my purchase. My apartment is small and doesnt require any intense vacuuming and my fascination for gadgets out-weigh anything else. (and any other excuse I can give to have one ) No complaints. My daughter turns it on and we sit back and watch it suck up one area of the room or entire roomSif needed. I even turned the roomba on when I thought there was'nt a need and the darn thing picked up a room full of dust !Yes I'm still very excited about it's capabilities but after a few more months of use I'll be writing another review hopefully about how it still works wonderSMy advice to everyone interested is to GET ONE !!
__label__2 A great (and fun!) tool, esp. for indoor/outdoor carpeting: I was teased pretty roundly for trying out a new "Techie Toy" but I have to say I'm wowed...it really does work!Dog hair, sand, dust, leaves, etc. have all found their way into my Roomba today. The kids room - especially under the beds - has never been quite this clean before. And the finished basement - with the indoor/outdoor carpeting - is spotless.As was previously mentioned, it does get itself into some tight spots. But I found the virtual wall to work quite well in preventing those issues.The charger takes a bit of time too. I'm impatient and admit I've been using it prior to letting it charge fully and it did a great job even on a partial charge.
__label__1 Very Disappointed.: Over a period of about 6 months I purchased 4 Roombas - 2 Pro Elites and 2 Discovery SE. All of them eventually failed. The first one was wonderful. I loved it. It lasted about 2 months. Then it began to simply turn on its axis and beep. I talked to I-Robot and they said it would have to be sent in. Instead I returned it and got another one. That too did the same thing in about a week. I then exchanged that one for a Discovery SE which had just been released thinking that they had probably fixed the problem with a new design. That one didn't even work out of the box. The 2nd Discovery SE lasted about a week and I finally returned it and decided to find another brand.When the Roombas worked they were wonderful but it was extremely frustrating when they stopped performing properly. I'm glad I am rid of them.
__label__2 Fun, Usefull, Requires A Little More Work Than Expected: Okay, so I love this thing.I got it as a gift for my mom, cause we have 8 persian (long hair) cats, and have to vacuum twice a week usually.This thing works like a charm, and picks up hair and dirt you didn't even know was there!Just turn it on once a day and let it run, but there is a little bit of prep work you have to do!1. Make sure no wires, clothes, blankets, etc are on the floors you want it to vacuum. If it runs over something and it gets stuck, it will usually get out, but plugged in cords, t-shirts, and thin blankets tend to stop him.2. In small bathrooms, leave the door fully open (against the wall), because it can get stuck if it bounces around and closes the door on itself.Other than that, charge it, run it, empty the bag (and clean hair out of the rollers), and repeat.Works like a charm!
__label__1 Disposable Electronics: The Roomba idea is clever and they can be handy during the warranty period but after that they are essentially disposable items. iRobot, the manufacturer, has cut so many corners to produce this clever device at a reasonable price that they cannot and will not supply spare parts. Five stars during warranty, 1 star thereafter.
__label__1 Battery So Poor, you should only use in a small apartment: My wife and I discovered that the battery use is less than 1 hour; and it takes 4 hours to recharge it!If you have a small apartment, this may work for you. If, like us, you have a larger home (2700+ sq ft)- pass this up. The Roomba did a great job of cleaning the bedroom, but used up its battery in the process. There is no way we could use it to clean the entire upstairs in 1 day, let alone the whole house. The battery just doesn't last that long.In summary, we returned it after 1 week.
__label__2 Surpised by how much I enjoy this CD: I had to play this CD over several times when I first got it, because I needed to be sure of what I had heard. These songs resonated deeply in me immediately. "Holy As a Day Is Spent" and "I Heard an Owl" are arresting songs, powerful in their connections. I remain astounded by how close to my feelings Carrie Newcomer's songs are; it's wonderful to hear my contemplative times articulated so harmoniously.
__label__1 terrible product: I do not see any improve due to the itching problem.it was stated in the brochure that THIS product is under satisfaction guarantee. I called the customer service, and I noticed that the seller misleadinghe will give u the manufacturing phone in UTAH then when u call Utahshe will say you have to call the seller to return your product.BEWARE BUYER !!
__label__2 Pet Gate: Nicely made. Very easy to install. Impotrant - Bottom stays on the floor. Would have been 5 Star if it had a knob/handle on the top (which I added) to make it easier to open and close.
__label__1 less than expected: I've expected more from the disc. The melodies remind one another, the performance also could be better.
__label__1 Pretty pictures, gorgeous yarns, somewhat boring designs: I just got this book for my birthday, and was excited about it, because at the first glance, the book looks nice, and the sweater designs seem sane and comfortable.That is, until I actually looked at the patterns and instructions, and noticed a recurring theme in most of the designs.In fact, many of the instructions in this book seem to more or less go like this:1. Take 2km of hideously expensive yarn.2. Cast on 120 stitches, using the biggest needles you can find3. Knit two squares of garter/stockinette stitch.4. Make two sleeves.5. Sew together, leaving a small hole for your head.6. wear your bulky shapeless sweater which only looks nice because the yarn is gorgeous.
__label__2 Fun but difficult: This is a fun compilation of "Animaniacs" songs. Unfortunately, "Animaniacs" songs are so rapid fire that it's hard to keep up if you know the words, much less if you're trying to follow along with the lyrics on screen. (And I'm a grownup!)
__label__2 Great collection: This set of DVD is a nice collection to have if your child likes Thomas. It makes a great gift too! And for the price, 3 DVDs are definitely worth it.
__label__2 Perry Mason Magic: This DVD is a wonderful collection of early Perry Mason. If you are a fan of Perry Mason then I would recommend you purchase this DVD. It is so nice to watch the TV with no commericals, swearing or nude sceens.
__label__2 Classic TV: I grew up watching Perry Mason and now can share them with my own children. The first reaction is a groan but within ten minuetes everyone is gluded to the show and with no sugestive ads that I have to explain.
__label__2 One of the best new bands I've heard in a long time: Loopy pop is how I describe their sound. I grew up in the 80s and was thick in the Indie music scene (back when it actually WAS indie). This is the first band I've heard since then that has a very fresh sound. The first I heard a song, I downloaded a few more and then bought the CD. Listening to the songs, I truly feel like the band is having fun making good music, not copying other bands and trying to make a million bucks. I listen to this CD over and over again.
__label__1 Defective Item: Audio 1/4" to 1/8" Stereo Adapter does not work. It's a waste of $4. I will not buy anything from EZ Electronic Mall.
__label__2 Your baby will love this!: I received one of these blankets as a gift from my mother. It is SOOO soft, and we took it to the hospital with us when we were delivering. The nurses at the hospital nursery even fell in love with it, and asked where they could buy some! My son stays so warm and loves the feel of it so much we had to go out and buy more of them, as he prefers them over his other blankets. Definitely a great investment!
__label__1 Incoherant, Misquoting, incomprehensible literature!: Many sentences are incomplete, and the author misquotes scripture. The majority of this book are quotes, assumptions, and fiction. He support the majority of minor issues and does not provide evidential support for his own opinions so the reader has no idea how he came up with them.
__label__2 Great music - fits the series!: This is great music. I have not seen any of the anime yet, but I do read the series, and this OST even goes well with that. The period and mood are accurately portrayed by the music. It has just the right mix of happy and creepy. One of the tracks makes me think of an antique carnival where you expect monsters to jump out at you. If you enjoy this series in either form, I would definitely recommend getting this cd.
__label__1 Too Messy, Slow Delivery: While the get started eyes is great, the foundation kit is messy and does not cover as well as advertised. Cover Girl liquid power foundation is better. The company this was ordered from was very slow with delivery.
__label__1 Disappointed: I really did not like this product. I went from being a liquid foundation wearer to this and was very disappointed in the lack of coverage. I was attempting to use this as an alternate means of covering acne scars and uneven skin tones but the end result was yuck! I spent more time trying to apply and reapply to get the a similar result as the liquid foundation.I feel this product is better for someone with less problem skin.
__label__1 Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this Product: After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. I have never had a reaction like this otherwise. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands that do not contain it.
__label__1 Disappointed: I really wanted to like this movie. I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.
__label__1 Don't bother: The production quality of this movie is shockingly bad and so is the acting. The acting is so terrible that it distracts you from the story. It's really really low budget. If you compare the production of the movie Jeremiah, Esther or Joseph for example which were excellent bible movies this is embarrasingly bad. It's such a pity because the bible book of Ruth is a beautiful account.The Book Of Ruth
__label__2 Great Swing: This swing/bouncer chair has been really great. The only problem that we have is the chair doesn't seem to fully lock into place into the base. My son seems to like the bouncing the best but you have to do this manually. I guess everything cannot be automatic. The strap system is a bit complicated yet holds him safely in the chair.
__label__2 An outstanding must read!: I've just finished this book and could not put it down it was a page turner. This is a new author but he has a feel like E. Lynn Harris however he develpos his own style and goes to a new level of exploring gender issues. The main character Jefferson Daniels is a married man that goes to his fraternity convention and is faced with his deep personal struggle of his same sex, sexual struggle. He meets a man named Adonis who he finds very attractive. All the while Jefferson is dealing with his spirituality and how the world views the desires he has had since childhood. This author explores the relationship with religion and homosexuality, friendship, and heterosexual marraige. The book has twist and turns in it, and is based on true to life stuff. The world better whatch out for this brother. Get your copy today!
__label__2 We waited and requested for 2 long years. Finally.: This is by far the best ever Beauty and the Beast ever written. I bought it years ago and have my hard copy still. When my vision got worse, luckily the Kindle was created and my problem was solved- except that I missed some of my old friends. Then the folks at Amazon added a place where you can (with a click) ask an author to permit a kindle copy. My daughters and I wanted this on Kindle--- We asked repeatedly -- at least every 2 months from all three of us. We prevailed. YAY.
__label__2 Fun!: This story of a San Francisco governess and a magician turned werewolf is an entertaining blend of magic and love. Lacky manages to steer clear of the Disneyfication that could have cropped up in the tale. Alongside the archetypal fairy tale are Chinatown whorehouses and the genral squaller of the seedier part of San Fransisco circa the early 2oth century. Recomended for those times when your head has been buried in Crowley for three weeks and feels as though its about to explode!
__label__2 want your kids to mature??: Jamie's songs do not always say things that are just immediately familiar, but rather he sings about unfamiliar parts of the Bible in ways that will draw children in and make them curious about those unfamiliar parts. He uses children in the singing and very fun little verbal blurbs make my kids want to be a part of it.Another thing about his songs is that they are matter-of-fact about tough parts of Scripture and tough principles and theologically informed. This music will lead children to mature rather than just want to be entertained with happy clapping and dancing bears.Don't get me wrong, these songs will make kids laugh occasionally!
__label__2 Not Free SF Reader: Adventuring with aliens and aztecs.What seems to start off as a run of the mill adventure type tale reminiscent of something that Idriess or Fenimore Cooper might have come up with, develops into something a lot more complex.A human colony is cut off after the closing of a wormhole and the use of emp nuclear weapons devastates the technological level of a planet.Opposing alien races plot and scheme using humans to do their dirty work, while a couple of enhanced humans try and get by on the planet after enduring several centuries of waiting.When one finds the other, the conflict between aliens and humans turns into war. Human sacrifice, airships, seaships, spears, guns and whatever else can be used to fight with, is, as the secret to operating a much more powerful type of ship is fought for.This book ends a lot more strongly than it starts, building nicely throughout.
__label__2 The One--Elton John: Love this CD. I think it is one of Eltons' best--good variety. "Runaway Train" with Calpton is great.
__label__1 I didn't get Techno Bears, I got standard Haribo bears: The product I got, the standard Haribo Golden Bears, get five stars. I didn't order Haribo Golden Bears, I ordered the Techno Bears. Pretty disappointing, be careful about ordering.
__label__1 Roomba worked pretty good for a couple weeks: The Roomba actually worked better than I thought it would. I have a combination of hard and carpeted floors.Even thought it cannot get everywhere, it does get to places you generally do not when vacuuming the old way.I would have been a happy user and given it a good rating, but unfortunatly after a couple weeks it failed. I got an error code stating that a wheel was stuck. The wheel was definately not stuck, but I was unable to get this warning/beep code to stop. Fortunatly I was within the 30 day return period.I would have considered getting it fixed, but considering the poor customer support that is suggested in the reviews, I decided to save myself the trouble of spending hours on the phone.My sense from the start was that it would not function very long, it's fairly cheaply made in my opinion. I did expect it to work longer than a couple weeks though.
__label__2 I was skeptical but I was wrong!: This robot works! This is no toy. When I was given this robot for a gift my first question to my wife was, "Can we return it if it doesn't work?". I was really skeptical. Boy was I wrong! The little robot really cleans, and cleans well! As a test, I vacuumed with our regular upright and then had Roomba come in behind to see if it could pickup anything. After Roomba finished its job, its dirt bin was full! It's worth every penny!
__label__1 Durability Problems: I have had two ROOMBAs (A Discovery and Discovery SE) for about five months now. We have three German Shepherds, multiple cats and a large house. Our ROOMBAs are used twice daily on the MAX setting.Although they clean well I've had lots of problems keeping them functional with multiple cliff sensor and brush drive failures despite cleaning them, cleaning the brushes and blowing them out with air after each use. The folks at I Robot have been great about replacing them under warranty but the process is beginning to get tiresome. I can only conclude that long-term durability is, at best, questionable and that maintenance is far greater than that of a "normal" vacuum. The whole equation adds up to time saved having a robot vacuum = zero.
__label__2 My wife loves her Roomba: This thing is practically a member of our family. My wife loves it. It works very well for us, with wood floors and not much carpeting. It doesn't do well with thick carpeting, but oriental-type rugs are fine. It has some trouble with the transition from floor to rug if the rug is very thick with a pad under it, but the rug can be done separately if this happens.It's easy to clean and use. We're still using the original filter after about 6 - 8 months.Everyone who gets one loves it.
__label__1 A Pain...: to remove the hair/fur from the brushes, and then have to go and grab the regular vacuum cleaner to clean up the post roomba clean up mess...
__label__2 Better then I thought it could be: I love my Roomba!! I am so amazed with what this little machine can pick up. I have wood floors, tile, low carpet and thick carpet, and it works on all of them. It doesn't mark the wood floors, and it picks up very fine dirt and dust. Believe me I give it a work out with two 3 year olds running around. If you purchase be sure to take good care and empty the dirt compartments often and clean the brushes. It doesnt have a large capacity. Jeannine
__label__1 Not ready for prime time: Great technology packed into a tiny machine that buzzes around and cleans your floor. The problem is it didn't last long for me. I used it mainly to clean the bathroom floors and under furniture. It saw use about once a week for 6 months before it failed. The power light would turn red immediately after a long charge. A new battery didn't fix the problem. Anything could have failed.On the other hand, my 10-year old Panasonic floor vacuum (also bought at Amazon) is still going strong and cleans better.
__label__1 Disappointed: It did not pick up everything. It missed a few spots that it covered.In addition, it completley missed my living room which is open to the dining room and kitchen
__label__2 Three kids later and I love it just as much!: I *love* my Roomba. It is impossible to be unbiased! I run it every day, for the full two hours. I have three children 5 and under and it picks up all the trails they leave behind and track in the house. In fact, it's the only way I can get them to pick up toys! "Pick up your toys so the Roomba doesn't eat them!" and off they go. It has survived being dropped, stepped on and kicked by a two-year-old.The stop-at-an-edge feature works great. I will put my Roomba up on the 8-foot wall that divides out living area from the kitchen (I have vaulted ceilings) and it will clean the 3-foot wide wall with now problems; it doesn't fall off!I would highly recommend the Roomba, without reservations, to anyone with kids or pets. It has really saved my sanity to be able to pick up the small pieces, start the Roomba, and know that the carpet will soon be clean. We installed new carpet two years ago and it still looks new!
__label__2 So Far So Good: We've had our little Roomba for over a month now and have run it almost every day.We are very satisfied, I just hope it lasts a long time.
__label__2 Roomba cleans well, requires a little prep to use: The Roomba actually cleans much better than I expected it would. It picks up a lot of stuff. It really cleans up the pet hair. It also works especially well at getting under things like couches. The only negative is that it requires a bit more prep to use. You have to pick everything up out of the room first. When using a normal vacuum I can usually get away with just moving things from one side of the room to the other. With Roomba you pretty much have to get everything off the floor.
__label__1 doesn't work: I bought a Roomba for myself, my MIL, my mom and my grandma at Christmas... boy did I get taken. Out of FOUR vacuums, I got FOUR duds. They do NOT clean well. They run out of charge faster than I do. They get all disoriented when they run into walls. (Hello! All houses have walls!)I don't get how anyone can view this as a great product, but to each their own I guess. All I know is I bought 4 and all 4 ended up in the trash can.
__label__1 No charger came with it: This item didn't ship with a charger. There was a notch in the foam for it but it was empty. Ended up having to spend an extra 40 for a new charger....Im sure the product works great but buying it from amazon was a waste...
__label__2 Good product: I ordered a refurb version of this a while back, but it was broken on arrival. Then my daughter ordered one and I saw how it worked. I then ordered a new one and am happy with it. It is NOT quiet and I would NOT run it unattended. It has a tendency to lock itself in rooms until its batteries run out. It cleans well and gets into places I wouldn't bother with (under sofas, etc.)
__label__2 Saves You Time when well maintained: This unit will vacuum a level of your home while you go out to run some errands, do laundry, play with the kids, etc. It vacuums to you don't have to. One can say that one would vacuum more often using this device than an active hand held device. I certainly do. I vacuum every day. Multiple times per day. Literally. This device enables you to do that.However, everything has a price. The price here is maintenance. However, you can do that maintenance at a time where you have time, and keep the unit running in peak performance.Buy a spare batteryiRobot Roomba APS 4905 Batteryand a fast chargerROOMBA P/N2004 Rapid Charger for Roomba and have continuous service after swapping the battery and emptying the dust bin!Buy One for sure!
__label__1 it always dies: I have had 4 roomba's in 3 months. The longest one lasted was 10 hours. The last one died after 2 hours. I am taking it back and will get my money back.
__label__2 Monkey Around: My daughter wanted this nursery set. Received it and it is a very high quality set. Not disappointed at all. Would highly recommend manufacturer to anyone.
__label__2 Excellent, Real Clean and Best of Price Performance & Easy: We are 100% satisfied about our decision to buy Bissell for its performance in cleaning and suction. Easy to operate, relatively less noisy [My old Eureka was making horrible noise] and best price with nice look.I did spent a week or more for research and study when my current Eureka smoked out. This time, I don't want to go wrong, needed a better cleaning Vac as my son would be 6 months soon & getting ready to crawl. Read Reviews, went to shops to feel its sturdy and quality aspects.I wanted best performance for reasonable PRICE. Bissell 3576-ClearView II is the WINNER and we are satisfied. Removing, cleaning of cup is easy. Suction is great.
__label__1 Cheap and useless: I had this vacume for less then a year. in that time I found that it clogged easily, and on bare floors it really could not handle anything larger then sand.There was smell of burning rubber, and then the spinning brush no longer worked.As for the design, the power button is in a inconvenient place. i should have retuned this immediately. Oh well, never another Bissell.
__label__2 Underappreciated yet Great Tull Album: This album has been much underappreciated it seems and the poor mastering on the original CD release didn't help ... however, this remastered version is here to set the record straight ... not only do you get a nicely remastered CD you get 8 bonus tracks, none of which are simply filler ... in fact, I enjoy the bonus tracks every bit as much as the previously released ones ... Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow has become one of my absolute favorite Tull tracks ... I cannot see where a true Tull fan would be without this CD remaster ... it is essential Tull in my book ... plenty of flute, lots of folk influence, good balance of electric to acoustic, nice mandolin and great writing and musicianship abounding ... enjoy!- Scriptor
__label__1 a BIT overrated ?!?!: says a reviewer below. a BIT ?in the 10, 15, who remembers, years i had this album, i listened to it maybe 3 times. and i just skimmed thru it again, and realized: i hadn't missed a thing. this is one of the worst jethro tull albums ever. if you wanna buy it because you need to complete your tull catalog, go ahead, curb that economy. if you're new to tull, run the other way, there's plenty of good tull albums to be had.points to tull for trying to be contrmporary with this one, i.e. jump on the 80s bandwagon of "listen mom, i got meself a synth". but time has been unkind. listen to the sample of fallen on hard times, it tells the story.
__label__1 Cold Coffee: I bought this coffee maker and I regret it. This machine is heavy and awkward and the coffee is cold. Buyer Beware
__label__1 How in the world could this be?: This is a sham. It is a trick. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you like karaoke versions of your favorite 80s songs. THERE ARE NO ORIGINAL ARTISTS ON THIS CD. Who in their right mind would buy this swill?
__label__2 The Water of Life: Explore the greatest and the most exclusive vineyards in the world from South Africa and New Zealand to the Napa Valley of California and the Bordeaux region of France.
__label__2 Lost Child: This book is a page turner. Couldn't put it down the first time I read it. Have read it three times. I love all the historical background. Keep giving Mommy is missing and Lost Child to my friends to read and they also love it. This book begs for a sequel,I hope there will be a third book!
__label__2 Strang's books: I learned linear algebra from an earlier edition ofStrang's book many years ago at MIT and it has onlygotten better. I thought then and still think that thepresentation is excellent and the main ideas areextraordinarily accessible-- it is not thetheorem:proof presentation typical of many advancedmathematics texts which can obscure the underlyingstructure for folks not intent on becoming mathematicians(and perhaps even some budding mathematicians too).Now that said, it might be too wordy for a reference textand perhaps could use a quick reference guide somethingakin that seen in introductory books on other topics(the LaTeX book by Lamport or Ritchie's C book). However,a better go would be to simply use Strang to LEARN thematerial and then any of a variety of reference bookscollaterally (kind of like using Yates and Goodman forlearning probability, but Papoulis or Feller for a reference).
__label__1 Dead after 3-1/2 holes: Perhaps the bit I got was defective, but I am totally disappointed in the bit I received. I'm drilling hard porcelain tiles, something the bit claims it is intended to handle. The first hole the bit went through like the proverbial hot knife through butter. By the third hole it was slow going. Less than half way through the fourth hole I quit. Upon examining the bit there are no signs of overheating and there is also nothing on the bottom cutting face except polished metal.I've ordered another one, but only because for $3.99 and Amazon Prime I can get it here next day and finish on time. But in the future I certainly won't buy Hitachi bits.And for those who might wonder, yes I did use water cooling. I've worked with tile and drilled enough holes to know how a bit should perform, and it definitely shouldn't perform like this one.
__label__1 The Monkees Mystery Tour.: And not unlike their British counterparts pitiful venture the prior year in a confusing and painfully fossilized piece of Tv cinema the Monkees should have learnt when a movie is a "Trip" and when its something that you trip over.The Monkees were great fun as a TV show and their music was different and their determination to prove themselves by rehearsing and actually going out on tour to show they were more then a concocted garage band showed dedication and that they were not a One Hit Album Wonder. But sadly this movie like Mystery Tour has no purpose other then to portray some real talent going through some senseless paces in a boring and outdated film.
__label__2 Very strange indeed, but it's The Monkees and I love 'em.: This is pretty wild for The Monkees, but they were making a statement about their prefabness and the media's comments about their inability to perform live. I for one loved this movie. It is definitely one of the best cult movies of the decade.
__label__2 Simply Unbelieveable: This movie is not one for the casual Monkees fan, and definately NOT for anyone who is fond of their early period "bubblegum" pop. It's a heavily psychadelic look at the Monkees' origins, the problems they had, and of their personal characters. It is revoloutionary both now, and back in '68 for a number of reasons (first film to use colour solorization techniques, first English speaking film to be shown in "Le cinema verite" latin cinema...). It's a great film, with truly killer music, and should be respected as such. Do not simply disregard it as a 90 minuite Monkee episode!
__label__2 Bringing Holistic Awareness to the community: I thought that the documentary had a very urban approach.Using a practicing holistic wellness consultant that alsois an MC gives the documentary a sincer feel. Super NovaSpeaks from the heart, which is hard to find in this error of hip-hop.Everyone that was interviewed had something profound tosay about holistic wellness and how it can affect the community.Overall I think that this film will be scrutinized because of theSubject mater and because it is the first of its kind...It's a great learning tool and my children love to watch it.
__label__1 Returned: I bought this item because I was looking for something that would hold me in especially when going out. I was totally disappointed with this product. Doesn't fit or hold you in good at all. I returned this product after trying it on. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 don't purchase: Rollers were noisy, almost louder than the music. Eventually the rollers must have jammed because the tape player would reverse in the middle of a song.
__label__2 the most awesome anime series ever: This title is WAY better subtitled- it's worth the extra money to hear the voices of the best voice actors in Japan. Heck, who can beat Seki Tomokazu (voice of Chichiri)?
__label__2 If you like The Onion you'll love this book: If you are not afraid of humor at its darkest, sickest, strangest and certainly most un-politically correct you'll love this book. These cartoons reminds me of Spike & Mike's Sick & Twisted Animation Festival. It's also nice to see a Callahan book with a theme (Dogs). On the other hand if you like your humor simple & sweet I suggest you stay with Family Circles.
__label__2 Worth the money: I have been using this product for about 10 years and about 6 vehicles. It works great, no problems, the only thing to be aware of is it lasts for about three seasons here in Michigan and starts to fade away. I just power wash and re-apply. The second time I apply it takes half the amount of the first application. It's ALWAYS stuck and dries just fine. I've never got rust under my vehicles and it actually makes removal of nuts/bolts much easier because of that. Worth it, worth it, worth it..........
__label__2 Not as good as Herodotus, but good enough: This was a very interesting and easy book to read concerning this ancient 30-year Greek civil war that was so devastating to the whole of Hellas. Too bad the author dies before being able to complete the work. Reading this made me think how US politicians and rhetoreticians pay lip service to Athenian democracy while in fact this democracy was very different from US democracy and was a democracy that only included Athenian male citizens while women were excluded. Athenian democracy also supported slavery and was abusive to its subject states. Reading this book one learns that the Athenians were the bad guys and that Pericles was a leader who looked out for his peoples interests while disregarding other peoples well being.
__label__2 Concise: A true classic. Very easy to read, and contains many great speeches within it (including Pericles' funeral oration). More-or-less objective, although does favour the Anthenians (mostly noted through diction). Easy to understand.
__label__1 cushion: you only get one of these in the package. it's just a little better than the terrycloth one i got ,but it too is misleading. he didn't work for me.
__label__1 Temporary relief: I had horrible pain in my foot over the summer and went to the doctor who diagnosed me with hammertoe. She told me I needed orthotics but I couldn't afford them so I looked online for some alternatives. The pain was mostly in the ball of my foot so when I found this cushion, I thought it would be perfect! So, the first couple of days, I loved it! However, the cushion moves a lot so I ended up having to use tape to keep in place which was a pain. Then after 2 weeks, the cushion was completely flat and provided no relief. Now, I have to provide full disclosure that I work in downtown Chicago which means I do a ton of walking (3-4 miles per day). So I wonder if the cushion would last longer for someone who didn't do the heavy walking I do but even then I question the durability of the product. Overall, it was cheap which I can't complain about and it did provide a few days of pain free walking but I would not purchase it again.
__label__1 Disappointed: These were not as sturdy as other clamshell cases I have had before. They are also more difficult to lock closed.
__label__1 Bad Customer Service!: My problem is not with the product, my main issue is with ANTOnline and their customer service. First, they listed the product as "in stock" when in reality they were "out of stock". They emailed me to let me know it would take them an additional 5 to 7 days to get their order in and then send it to me. I understood their situation and then requested that they express ship me my order so I could meet my event deadline since they added additional days before I would receive the product. Unfortunately, this request was denied by several of their customer service reps who responded to the email trail. OMG - can't one person be your main contact so they know the whole story. I finally received my shipment 3 weeks after I placed my order. Would I buy from them again, no! Look for another vendor that understands what good customer service is.
__label__1 Oh Please!: It's really a pity that some people never seem able to admit when a theory is really a theory. This is a eloquent and educated work, but evolution is as much a religion as this writer claims it is not. As it's own blurb puts it "it is not surprising that a great deal of information is either glossed over or omitted entirely". This is attributed to 'avoiding controversial subjects'. Yet the author can so clearly and concisely present all other arguments? Forgive me, but the entire issue is controversial and is only a very recent argument in our history. Anyone who reads this book should also check out 'The FACE that Proves the Farce' by Hank Hanagraph and some of the valid arguments against evolution. Unless, of course, they prefer to be force fed this theory without educating themselves on both sides of the argument. By the way do you know that even the best colleges in our nation and the world are questioning this theory that we have been sold. Check it out.
__label__1 Appalling: I'm sure glad I got this book as a gift, because I don't like thinking that I'd have wasted money on it. UGGHHH!For 18 bucks, you get 12 pages of horrible art, and a mediocre-at-best cover illustration. This is a depiction Boba Fett ariving in Tatooine orbit with Solo, getting attacked by IG-88, and getting Solo to Jabba. Unfortunately, 95% of the story, dialogue, etc has been cut out. They counted, I guess, on it being "The Pop-Up Comic Book" to make this good. It wasn't. A horrible waste of money and resources.If I were the rest of you, I wouldn't touch this stinker with a ten-foot cattle prod!
__label__1 Holocaust Denier and Proven Fake: David Irving has been proven to fabricate facts out of thin air and to misrepresent any true information in his research. He is a self-declared fascist and a Holocaust Denier, reader beware you will be only getting a well worded half truth in his books, along with an underling message from a truly sick man.
__label__2 The Right Stuff: Great variety of Vanessa's best. She displayed her dancing skills in these videos, along with her gorgeous voice.
__label__1 Disappointing with no real action: This movie should only be seen on tv and is not worth spending the money. Even the grandkids were disappointed.
__label__2 Beautiful Hot Babe: Granted this is only 5 videos, but it's 5 videos in a DVD I never had. Chely is so beautiful with songs I enjoy, that this DVD was a must to see her on my big screen tv. Too bad this is the only DVD to have Chely videos, and only 5 at that. Hope she comes out with more."1997: Let Me In"01. Shut Up And Drive (#14 US Country/#112 Billboard)"1999: Single White Female"02. It Was (#11 US Country/#64 Billboard)03. Single White Female (#1 US Country/#36 Billboard)"2001: Never Love You Enough"04. Never Love You Enough (#26 US Country)05. Jezebel (#23 US Country)
__label__2 Gullah for You : A dictionary: This is a very good dictionary for anyone who is interested in the Gullah people & their language. I heard about the Gullah people from my Aunt who works for the Wycliffe Bible Translators. Since I live in the Carolinas and I'm very interested in other languages I thought I might need a dictionary to help with some of the harder pronunciations in all the Gullah books that I've purchased.This book has helped a great deal since it has the phonic pronunciations for each word.I do think that they should have put the word "dictionary" in the title so everyone would know before they purchased the book so that is the only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars.
__label__2 learning: These books that I have bought from amazon.com are needed if I am to learn to make bull whips. Also were required reading reading.
__label__2 First timer raves.: Tianwa Wang's Sarasate CD is sensational. I am a professor of political science in his mid-60s. While I have loved classical music all my life and am undefeated in the old needle-drop contests that classical music lovers occasionally enjoy at their nerdy parties, I have never written an on line review of a recording and may never again. But THIS performance demands one. I have NEVER heard a violin performance of anything by anybody that has given me as much pleasure as this recording. Wang makes every sound a classical violin is capable of making. High harmonics whistle. Low notes sound like only a viola could make them. Every note is so shaped as to have its own unique personality. The double stops are impeccably balanced. The pianist accompanies to perfection. Buy this recording, then challenge your friends who say "I don't much like violins." not to change their minds and fall in love.
__label__2 Good overall, but some out of date information: This is one of the best books for hikes in LA County. It covers a wide variety of locations, including Catalina Island, the Santa Monica Mountains, and the San Gabriel Mountains. Unfortunately, information on some of the hikes is out of date. Clearly, this is always a problem with books on hiking trails since conditions do change, but it seems that the description of the hike from Vincent Gap to East Fork along the San Gabriel River is particularly out of date. According to the book, this 14 mile downhill hike will take 9 hours. Given the extreme deterioration of the trail, it will be difficult for even an experienced hiker to complete it in less than 14 hours. It seems unlikely that this deterioration has taken place in the short time since the book was published.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY: This item came with no instructions. Do not waste you time or money on this "EASY TO BUILD ITEM. You will be very very unsatisfied. This company needs a reality check on to what easy build means. Very close to calling the better buisness burrow.
__label__1 UbD Review: I learned about this product in a professional learning seminar at my school before I ever bought the book. The department head discussed the same concepts in a much more concise manner. The book uses unnecessarily elevated language instead of simply stating the process for implementing backwards design. The text often referred to terms that were only listed in the glossary, and the glossary definitions were presented in jumbled and vague language. The concept and process is only clear to the reader because of the sample handouts in the text. Had I not known about backwards design before reading this book, I would not have implemented the concepts unless required to do so because the process (as explained in the book) contains many more steps than necessary to achieve the desired result.
__label__2 Great reference book: This book has been the perfect companion to another book called "clay and glazes for the potter" by daniel Rhodes.
__label__1 where is it: i am very upset i have not received it yet ? where is it ?please send it ! first time i have had this problem !
__label__2 Kangaroo Court: "We have pictures of a soap factory where they hit the victims, mostly Poles, with a blunt instrument, and the heads are cut off and boiled in one vat and the bodies in other vats. Three hundred heads were found in one vat at the time of discovery." This (wholly fictitious) statement was written by an American lawyer named FL Felton in a letter home (p 131 of this book).Irving's detailed account of the Nuremburg trials makes for dismal, but perhaps necessary, reading for any such as myself who looked for justice and "due process" in this apparently now discredited and even shameful farce.I personally had also wished to trace the path of the attempted peace-maker Rudolph Hess, and it too is covered up to his "mysterious" death (by strangulation) at age 93 while in the care of the British in Spandau prison.As others have noted, this is not the easiest of Irving's books to read.Then again, the subject matter -- the Allies' sense of justice -- makes it so.
__label__2 Little did we know...: Impt. book. Very few of us know of this relationship. It's difficult to accept and it is true.
__label__1 junk: i bought this to hook up my electric fan on my car & could not get this to work dont wast your money
__label__1 thermostat?: Well I installed this item on my truck and it flat out didn't work basically just a headache to install (illegible instructions that make no sense at ALL) and once I did figure it out on my own it didn't work. Piece of junk. Don't waste your money...
__label__1 Junk: Installed and the fan would not shut off, looks like unit had been already installed. Opened unit and contacts were sticking. Fan now won't turn on.
__label__1 Bad Picture: We also ordered this part based on the picture that was shown which looked like a fan clutch. Only when we received the package did we see that it is another part. It seems that they have just changed the picture on this item recently because now that we review our order, the picture is accurate--too late for us as we now have the wrong part.
__label__1 A Great Pocket Radio but Very Frail: The DT200V is fantastic...BUT, the two AA batteries are heavy and the battery holder is weak. If you drop this radio on a hard surface the holder will break and then you can kiss your radio good bye. I've purchased several of these radios and all suffered the same end.Get the DT-300VW instead. It uses two, lightweight AAA batteries and is tougher. I'm going to buy another. My previous one finally suffered a weak key and spontaneous autoscan.
__label__1 Doesn't hold up: I purchased this radio, wanting to get the best portable, pocket am/fm radio out there. I've owned it for 4-5 years and it no longer receives my favorite am station without a popping noise. I made sure there wasn't any local influences. My other radios work fine and the station comes in just fine on the other radios. I think I will but another cheapy sony or panasonic.
__label__2 Sangean DT200VX: Actually, the Sangean DT200VX exceeded my wife's and my expectations for such a small radio. It has better AM reception than the Sangean DT220 that it is replacing and is very easy to operate as a bedtime radio. With it's lighted display and the MY button that allows you to select the stations that you programmed (in my wife's case: AM, FM, and local TV), it's easy to use in the dark. Excellent battery life as well. Very pleased with this radio and I'm considering a second for me!
__label__2 200X: Excellent radio, a little heavy, but radio reception is great. I listen to the radio while working out in a metal building.
__label__1 What is the purpose of this book?: I am just thinking what is the purpose of this book. People wondering about how CLEAR the pictures are. Yes. It should be given 1 star.But, with these clear pictures the book can be used to show a person who is new to yoga, about how different asanas look like.It could be really difficult and in my personal opinion, dangerous to start practising with this book as the only reference. Asanas are displayed without any explanation/directions.[webaite]has proper explanation for each asana.Breathing plays 60% of work and final pose playes 40% of the work. Without knowning about how to breathe in each asana, you can not get anything from it.You should need additinal reference from Iyengar Yoga books or Viniyoga books where you get direction of how to go to eash pose with proper breathing.
__label__1 I am glad I didn't spend MY money on this desk...: I won a room makeover and chose this item as a new desk for my made over office. We received this desk a few weeks ago and it was WELL packed (4 stars) although because it was so well packed it was hard to get out of the box (it ships in two boxes).We had already put together another desk so we decided to put this desk together also. The directions were EXTREMELY hard to read (print very small) and the diagrams were hard to interpret. I did step one and decided to get a handy man to put the desk together for me. It took him 2 hours to put it togther.It is sturdy and seems sound. The hard drive fit well but my HP printer had to be placed on the bottom shelf sideways. You need a narrow upright printer for it to fit correctly on that shelfI would NOT buy this product again and I am real glad the money did not come out of my pocket.
__label__2 Awesome Album--Very underrated: This album is very underrated. If you don't have this album you should get it. The best songs on this album are "Take A Lick", "Coochie", "How Do You Feel", "Get Up", "P***y Makes The World Go Round", "Sister, Sister" & "Messin' With My Cru".
__label__2 play it again Marlowe: This is a very entertaining 60's detective romp. It isn't too dated for the most part. It is interesting to see a few of Rockford's traits in Marlowe, the Oreo cookies, the charm, and the slightly illegal activities.He is attacked by Bruce Lee's character and finesses his way out.He ends up further behind than he started like Rockford.I enjoyed this movie and found it unpredictable, funny and a precursor to Rockford.
__label__2 Love!: I was having major supply problems about 5 weeks into bf. Used this product for about y days before I really noticed a difference but I could nurse my son and then pump several ounces after he was done for later use. Only downside is that it tastes horrible. I always mixed it with a very small amount of juice and that helped. Highly recommended!
__label__2 Even Better: I've been a fan of the Hang-Ups from pretty much the beginning. I've always felt that their CDs don't hold up to their live shows. But that changes with Second Story. Don Dixon and Mitch Easter do a great job refining their soulful, melodic sound, but they've also added the punch from live shows that previous studio efforts missed. I can recite the same old comparisons to pop icons like the Kinks, Byrds and Paul Simon, but the best advice I can give is to get to their web site, find out when they're coming to your town and get yourself to the show. Or at least buy this CD. It's one of the best I heard in '99.
__label__2 we had one like this in the late 60's: I remember my mother and sisters went to the S&H; Green stamp store and got one just like this.I remember it worked great.so I thought I would get a new one for my little apt.and it is just as good as I remember.the new one is a whole lot lighter.new tough plastics instead of steel.you really have to empty it often,as it picks up EVERYTHING, fast.its quiet, you can hear it of course, but not in another room.yes,it has a handle that screws together,and you can unscrew them.if you don't like that, you could use super glue,or lock tight.this is just a sweeper,it's a simple tool, sweepers like this have been around for 100 years now,yes the had them in the 1900's.they were very expensive back then.this one is very nice.
__label__1 Not like my old Bissel: I needed to buy a new sweeper for my room where I keep my pets. I had to replace the one my daughter bent. This one though have big brushes under the bottom making it hard to move across the rug
__label__2 Awesome carpet cleaner: Some people left negative feedback on this product and I don't agree so I thought I'd leave a review myself.This product is AWESOME and I am very satisfied with it. It does just what it is supposed to; sweep carpets. It is very useful for me with a little kid leaving crumbs and stuff everywhere. For in between vacuuming it is nice to have something that isn't noisy and that pick everything up just like a vacuum. Of course you need to keep the brushes underneath clean and that is what the little comb that comes with the product is for. Do it every so often to keep the brushes from getting ruined.For its price it is the best investment I've done in a long time!
__label__1 u get what you pay for: enough said ..spend more or get stuck w/ this piece of junk..it came apart after 2 weeks & is unfixable..the brush part pops out EVERYTIME you make even one sweep w/ it ..after spending a half hour getting it back in ..it's not worth it
__label__1 A 'Reader's Digest' Sort of Tale: It seems as if M. H. Clark was 'made' to write a tale for Christmas by her editors. Her lack of enthusiasm is quite apparent by the lack of depth and intellect in this read. This book may appeal to the beginning reader, but it is very disappointing for others. Too simple, too predictable, too ho-hum, and does not grab the heart as I would have expected from Mary.
__label__2 Excellent: Would definitely recommend this movie. Very touching and heartbreaking at times. The type of movie a person can watch more than once.
__label__2 Awesome Impact, Awesome message: Great storyline with high impact on those who watch. It is worth every age watching it. I highly recommend it to singles and families.
__label__2 Refreshingly great story and acting.: The dichotomy of critics hating movie and audiences raving about it compelled me to watch it. Glad I did, this is a truly moving look at story few have the courage to tell. Am definitely looking forward to more works from this writing/directing team.
__label__1 This is a CHRISTIAN movie with a STRONG Anti-Choice and Abstinence ONLY message!!!!!: This movie is simply what my title reads. This is Christian propaganda shrouded in a movie format. There are two fundamental messages: anti-choice and abstinence ONLY. There are college students in this movie that on a road trip the boyfriends sleep in a separate room and the girlfriends share a room together. There isn't ONE SINGLE kiss in the entire movie despite there being a secondary storyline of a love story between two college students. Nothing wrong with any of this but I for one do not appreciate the underhanded way of luring me into the movie to hit me over the head with the propaganda. I think the directors and writers should me honest in the description and I am sure there will be PLENTY of Christians that will choose to watch it. I do not appreciate being lured into this blatant dogmatic sermon for anti-abortion/choice and abstinence on my time and $$$.
__label__1 Misleading and A Waste of Money and Time: We were extremely disappointed with how misleading the description of the movie was and felt like we were cheated out of our $3.99. We didn't even get a third into the movie before we had to turn it off out of disgust, but based on other reviews, it sounds like it only got worse from there. If I could get a refund on this purchase, I would in a heartbeat.
__label__1 HORRIBLE MOVIE: Well, first of all this movie is a Christian-based/anti-abortion movie - had no idea when I watched the trailer. I feel this movie is tasteless, bad acting and some-what criminal. If I knew I was going to watch religious-right propaganda I wouldn't have spent 3.99, I just would have gone on-line and read all the mustard. I feel I should be refunded by amazon, this was almost like a "bait and switch." Seriously, it's 2012, give me a break!
__label__2 Knowledge: This little book told me all I needed to know about Italian wines.Not complicated, no long drawn out chapters on either the wines or their region etc.
__label__1 Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: This dictionary was not made for ereader use, or if it was how to use it on such a device is not described.
__label__1 Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: I cannot find a usable keyboard to alphabetically find information. The review of the product was misleading. Perhaps someone could provide information as to how to make use of this dictionary.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: This electronic dictionary is not the same as the print dictionary. The dictionary does not have guide words on top of each page. It's very misleading for the publisher to have this electronic version that looks like a print version, but is not.
__label__1 Not searchable: I did not like the Kindle version of the dictionary. With a paper dictionary, you can quickly turn to the section you need, but with the Kindle version, you have to flip through hundreds of pages. You can't type in a word and have the dictionary go to that section. It's so cumbersome, we have never used it. I'm sorry I spent the money, especially when there are several online dictionaries that are easily searchable.
__label__1 Good Dictionary Bad Tabs: I liked the dictionary but was highly dissapointed to see that the tabs do not start at the start of the letter. why would you have tabs and not put them in the right place. it sucks.
__label__1 Good Dictionary but Working Badly for Kindle (rating for Kindle version): Undoubtedly it's a great dictionary in the paperback sense, but when I bought its Kindle version for my Kindle DX, it greatly disappointed me.Most people purchase dictionaries in Kindle versions for the integration with Kindle reading, but this dictionary fails to show definition in an acceptable format while reading a Kindle book. For eg., if you look up "devisive" it normally reads like"devisive /xxx also xxx or xxx/ adj ... " (xxx stands for pronunciation symbols)but when you look it up while reading, the definition skips all xxx parts and reads like"devisive also or adj ... "which does not make any sense.I strongly suggest a thorough review or reform of the format or Kindle-reading experience before any "Kindle-integrated" version of dictionary being published and sold.
__label__1 Interesting idea, painfully amateurish writing: The heading basically says it all. An interesting concept with some interesting characters, but the writer tries so hard to use colorful, complex language that you just space out trying to follow it. Way too impressed with its own cleverness.
__label__1 Seizing Amber Blows: Aside from the Amber Room itself being an interesting piece of history, the narrative of this book is overblown and unrealistic, while the writing itself is wooden.
__label__1 The pump did not work.: I couldn't get the bed inflated so it was a total waste of money. I thew it out. Don't waste your $.
__label__2 No Problems: I have owned this TV fo 6 Months now. It worked perfectly from day one with no problems. It has a superb picture even in SDTV mode. I don't understand all the problems the other reviewers report. Sometimes reading the instruction book really helps.
__label__1 Medium bird toy: I bought this toy for my parakeets. It was so big the birds were very scared. It is boxed now, waiting for a bigger bird I can give it too.
__label__2 Very sexy: You will get a lot of compliments especially from your significant other. When you wear this product, you will feel very sexy and sensual. This will is a great buy for a classic scent!!!
__label__2 Great for self-study: I almost finished his two volumes in 4 months. I really like his methods. While reading his book, I always do examples first and then check. Great! Highly recommended.
__label__2 Rock and ROLL: This book is awesome. I have used the methods described with fantastic success. In over twenty sessions at the tables I lost my table stake only once and that was because I deviated from my game plan. I usually double and even triple my table stake of $300.00. A great days income for an hour of fun. Use these methods and improve your game.
__label__2 Call your shots!: Ok. Maybe you won't be able to call your shots but this book will show you how to set the dice for maximum profits. We all know some shooters can control how the dice land. That takes years of practice. Zeke shows you how to set the dice to take advantage of controled shooting without all the practice. Zeke tells you which set to use for comeouts, making your point, and even one for the hardways. Get this book and start taking profits home.
__label__2 Intense wordplay and sparse beats: This group seems to have released very little material, which is a shame, because they certainly had the talent for more. Densely packed verses and simple, snappy drum beats make this an album which lives up to its sci-fi namecheck. You get the feeling, as in the movie "Alien," that you can't shake something that's just around the corner. Darkness preoccupies the writers as they spin tales of paranoia and tension. Is it really that kind of world, and if so, is it always going to be that way? Hear for yourself.
__label__1 I didn't get the product I ordered. I have sent them e-mails and have recieved no replies: I have a Sony Walkman CD player/radio combination D-NF430. I ordered the AC power adaptor for this and they sent me Sony AC-E45A Worldwide AC Power Adaptor with Folding Plug Blade. The male tip is too large to fit into the female AC power port on the walkman. I asked if they had an adapter but got no reply.Thank You,George R. Ramsey239-418-1671
__label__1 Not for Israel: I was going to buy this to power a Sony SW radio I have as I try to spend a month in Israel every year. The Sony weighs a bit and I would have been very sorry to take an adapter with me that did not work. Thanks for the advice.
__label__2 Great, but some static interference: Product does everything it says. It does tend to have a little more static interference than just using it on battery power, but not all the time and not enough to make it annoying.
__label__1 A Disappointment: My five year old son has been wanting this toy for months. He was so excited when he received it for his birthday. But to both our disappointments, the toy became a nightmare. Certain pieces fall off with a simple touch plus it's constantly falling over. Additionally, we couldn't find a car that worked well with it. Some were too light and some were too heavy. In both cases we had a hard time getting the cars to launch up the ramp. Basically, you're forced to purchase the cars that go with it separately. They are not included. After a couple of frustrating days of trying to play with it, my five year old son suggested we get rid of it.
__label__1 This toy is junk.: I am very surprised that a Company such as Mattel and Hot Wheels would let their name be put on such an item.This was finally opened on 2-25-05. My grandson was a guest and I wanted to have fun playing with him. After putting it together we started to play. Then it started to fall apart. Pieces fell off, put back on "correctly" just to fall off again.Thank 'God' we did not do slime. Can you imagine the mess!This toy rates at the very bottom of my list. Mattel, what were you thinking?
__label__1 peice of crap: my five year old begged for this toy and i resisted until two days before christmas and gave in because he kept telling everyone it was the only thing he wanted. It is poorly made and keeps falling apart. The cars have to be pushed along the track and do not go automatically on their own. The slime is sticky and what do you do with it after. He got two minutes of enjoyment and now it will go in the back of the closet never to be played with again.
__label__1 Slimecano is not a good time: Ok, i have to tell you, this toy is not a kid-friendly toy what so ever. It felt like we put more time putting this thing together and put together again (after falling apart over an over and over again)than we did actually playing it. This toy is highly NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!
__label__1 Hate this toy!! AVOID SLIMCANO: Every year I say I am not buying any hotwheels items, even though my son always askes for them. First it was The Fireball, it sucked, then Octoblast, it sucked, last year we got TRex which was slightly better, and then this year the worst- SLIMCANO. This toy falls apart as soon as you touch it,I put the whole thing together and my son starts to play with it and it starts falling apart, the "slim" is SOOOOOO messy,it ended up all over my carpet and house. As another reviewer wrote you have to clean this up every time you use it, what a pain!(By the way we did not put it away the last time we played with it, and the slim is all dried up) I love Matchbox products, this year we got The Rocket Park and it is a great toy, sturdy, durable, and hardly any assembly. DO NOT BUY SLIMCANO IT IS REALLY, REALLY WORHTLESS. Save your money
__label__1 TOTAL JUNK - DON'T BUY!: Don't be swayed by your kids' exposure to the heavy marketing push for this toy. It's made of such flimsy plastic that there's no way it could stand up to any child's touch. It even falls apart when an adult tries to use it. You'd might as well tear your money in little strips (which would be sturdier). Run from Slimecano as fast as you can!
__label__1 terrible toy!!!flimsy: the worst--just falls apart and very confusing. even older kids get frustrated w/ it
__label__1 JUNK-CANO!: We set up Slimecano on Christmas morning, and are ready to write to Mattel. They really "slimed" out on the fabrication of this thing. It is so poorly made, there is not one car that has made it around the track yet. The tracks bend like licorice, like there is some shortage of decent plastic in the world or something, the cars can't even get to the top of the track with their provided launcher, and the slime is on everything! You are supposed to wipe this down after each use.. hmmm.. how long is that going to take with all the crevices and parts on this thing? I want my MONEY BACK!!! This toy is worth about 9.99 in my opinion, not the 40- I paid for it! My son is so mad at this toy, the tracks keep falling apart he is just disgusted at this point. Definitely next week's garage sale giveaway...They really failed making this one...
__label__1 Horrible toy!!: My son got this for Christmas this year. He has 3 big cases of cars and not one single car (including the one that came with it) works. He can't touch the tracks without them coming off and then putting it back together is next to impossible. The slime isn't as messy as I thought it was going to be - that's the only good thing I can say about this horrible toy. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! And speaking of money, it's way way way over priced.
__label__1 Junk - that's all I can say: Junk - went to salvation army in a garbage bag the day after xmas. Good thing I got it on sale for $20
__label__1 Pick a different playset...: Slimecano takes forever to put together. Once together, My kids had fun with it- but only because of the slime. Cars get stuck and pieces constantly fall off. The slime is the best feature and it makes a mess! We bought Cyborg Attack later and it is so much better.
__label__1 A piece of junk-don't waste your money!: My 5 year old son was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift but we were extremely disappointed once it was assembled. The track pieces do not SNAP hard together so they are constantly separating. The crane falls off, the volcano head is too difficult for a child to put back together, the whole toy tips over very easily. The slime is alright as long as you are closely supervising the whole time if you aren't then be ready for a mess! This toy has been made so chep that it should be selling for only $10. I can't believe that we paid almost $40 for it! We pack the toy away because it was falling apart so much. My son just took it back out (3 months later) to try it again and was even more disappointed than before! It seems like such a fun idea but the toy just extremely frusterates children (and parents too)!
__label__1 Piece of JUNK!!!!: This item was a complete rip-off. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get this item for Christmas and WOW, was he disappointed! It fell apart after every car went over the track. It won't even stand up on it's own. The slime was the only interesting thing about this toy!
__label__2 Awsome Holiday Collection: Not your usual collection of various artists. I bought it for the Jim Brickman hit, The Gift. I was plesantly surprised by the content of this album and recommend it highly to those who like holiday music performed by contempory artists.
__label__2 great toy but, supervise at the beginning to prevent falling: My son has LOVED this toy for 5 months now (he is 12 months). At the beginning it is important to supervise your child as he/she gets used to pulling themselves up to standing with it because yes, it does fall over until they get the feel for it. It is the one toy that he has not got bored with.
__label__1 Boring.: My 12 month old son is a ball fanatic! But he was bored with this toy after 5 minutes. It was not worth the aggravation of putting it together. It also takes up a lot of room.
__label__1 not worth it: We bought this for our son when he was 9 months old and standing. It tips easily and certainly does not keep his attention. He has used it maybe 5 times in 6 months. Not worth the money
__label__1 Not much fun: My son doesn't really like this toy. I mean he likes the music which is very upbeat and he likes to play with the balls but he doesn't actually like to play with the toy as a whole. And there are the four "feet" on the bottom, that are so large they take up so much space on the floor and I don't really see a need for the "feet" at all. Plus the toy can't really be put away. We got this as a gift, it is not something I would have bought.
__label__2 My boys LOVE this toy: I received like a gift because I asked for it. After I opened, my boys tried to play with it. At the beggining, they didn't reach the top, but after a while they learn how to get up, throw the ball in the diffent holes, start the music, etc. For me the most cuttest thing is when one of my boys is playing in the family room, and he remember that toy in his bedroom and go to play with it, also with the lights of the room off (he likes to watch the lights). They also enjoy play just with the balls... they go to hard floor and they throw it and laught when they see what happened... they also hide the balls, so be prepared.... I recommend this toy 100%, you will not regret it
__label__2 Fun for little ones: My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday and she couldn't get enough of it from the minute she saw it. Now she's 17 months old and she still plays with it - just not as much any more. She leanred how to say "Wow!" and always dances to the music and she has never toppled it over or gotten hurt because of it. I love this toy and so does she.
__label__1 Not Satisfied: This toy was not created well for babies standing and starting to walk. My 9mo old kept falling down and while still holding the toy the toy fell over with him. Also, he would try walking while holding on to the wheel and the four feet at the bottom would trip him. They are out way to far for a first time walker. ...
__label__2 What a catchy Tune!!: I purchased this toy for my 11 month old and she loves it. Its one of the few toys out there that doesn't annoy me when it goes off. The only problem is the balls don't always end up in the same bay and she doesn't know to look for them. Also, she is able to support herself standing up on it and has only tipped over once since Christmas. She loves the balls and my 2year old also enjoys this toy. In fact I think she understands it much better then the baby.
__label__1 Pain to assemble, ended up being defective.: I had a hard time assembling the toy, especially the part where you have to put on the 'feet' and the rings. Once assembled, it didn't work. The ball kept getting stuck on the bottom ring. I returned the toy and don't want to see it ever again!
__label__1 You Can't Pull Up and the Balls Don't Blast: I bought this toy for my 9month old son. He is excellent at standing and has been pulling himself up and "cruising" for a month now. This toy couldn't support his weight at all. He is about 22lbs now. As soon as he reached to pull himself up, it toppled over. I found that the front of the box doesn't say what the toy "really" does. It doesn't allow your child to pull up and the balls definitely don't "blast" out of it. It also takes awhile to assemble. I definitely don't think this toy is worth buying, especially at the price they're charging. Don't waste your time assembling it, if you aren't sure about keeping it. It's impossible to take apart and return.
__label__1 Not as great as most reviews said. . .: I read most of the reviews on this particular toy which made me purchase it for my 8 month old (I normally find these review to be right on) but when I recieved this toy and put it together I was not impressed! I think the idea is a good one but it just doesn't work!! The balls get stuck on the bottom turn and when I finally push them through they all come out of the same spot! So much for the surprise of which side they will come out of. I called the 800 # as soon as I noticed that it just didn't work & they basically had no helpful advice. They said I may have got a defective one (I'd say!) I even took it apart and put it together again to make sure it was done correct. It looks exactly like the picture on the box but it just doesn't work. I will be returning it to the store!
__label__1 Not Recommended: Unstable, flimsy and improperly weighted are words that I would use to describe this product. We returned this item less than 24hrs after buying and assembling it. Our 7-month old, who's been standing with assistance for several months, was easily able to tip the Ball Blast over despite weighing only about 20lbs. The music and sound effects are fun and will surely put a smile on any child's face but the flimsy construction of the lower, yellow ramps are not conducive to bearing a young one's weight. The balls are a nice size for small hands and the adjustable volume control is a good feature. But the product does not live up to expectations and the quality is well below that of other Fisher-Price toys we own. Do think twice about buying this product as an aid to help you child pull up to a standing position. It's great when your baby is standing but the product's imbalance can lead to leaning and tipping over when used as intended.
__label__2 THIS TOY IS FUN FOR THE KIDS!!: My twin 12 month old babies just received this for their first birthday and absolutely love it!! The music is very upbeat and motivates my babies to dance and the expression on their faces when interacting with it is priceless.My children are not yet walking but are able to pull themselves up very confidently. I would like to say that parents should realize that although this toy IS called "Pull Up" Ball Blast, common sense tells us that it is not intended to have the weight and stability of a piece of furniture like a couch. Once your child is able to confidently pull to a stand up position using their legs, they will be fine. As always, supervision is the key keeping in mind children's development rates vary. Some children will be fine playing with it at 9 mos. and some maybe a little later.For those who were disappointed in the toy and didn't follow the manufacturers age guidelines, shame on you!!
__label__1 This looks like it OUGHT to be fun!: This toy looks great, has wonderful music and has been updated to include a wider base so it won't tip over with your kids!!! Unfortunately, my son (10 months) doesn't want to have anything to do with it.
__label__2 This is a great toy!: We got this toy for my son when he starting pulling up on things. It wasn't long before he was cruising all around it and bending to get the balls to put back in the top.My only knock would be that it while it encourages cruising it also hinders it because the bottom slides for the balls tend to be in his way causing him to trip.
__label__2 Great toy: My daughter loves this toy. She plays with it all the time. At first you think it's not really sturdy but she had no problem standing up with it.
__label__1 Better for cats than babies!: We bought this for our 9 month old granddaughter because some other parents had recommended it highly. Unfortunately, we are somewhat disappointed in it. As other reviewers have noted, it was a pain to put together, and it still doesn't seem to fit together quite right. (Maybe this is why the balls always seem to come out the same opening instead of all four.) Also, as other reviewers have noted, it is not very stable; we haven't had a real mishap since it's on carpet, but it's definitely not really designed for pulling-up babies. She likes the goofy sounds it plays, but she hasn't figured out how to put the balls into the openings yet. Also, better than half the time when I put the balls through, no music, sounds or lights are triggered. I discovered that you have to really push the ball against the triggering mechanism to make it play. In short, the cats have more fun chasing the balls around the house than the baby does playing with this toy!!
__label__1 TERRIBLE!: My husband and I really don't like this toy. First of all it is not very sturdy - my 8 month old easily tips it as she tries to pull up to standing. And it slides across the floor as she tries to pull up on it. Worst of all it is designed poorly as the the balls get stuck in the track as they spiral down - very annoying. It's too bad as this toy has potential. My daughter loves to stand and play and likes the silly music the toy plays. But now she only plays with the balls the toy came with.
__label__1 Get's my babies attention, but isn't safe at all.: My 10 month old gets a kick out of all of the noise this toy makes. I don't think the toy is appropriate for children who are not able to stand up without holding on to something for support. I always have to keep one hand on the toy to make sure it doesn't tip over. The entire toy is very unstable. I also think it is also difficult for a child to grasp what to do to the ball once it spins off the middle of the toy. My friend has a 22 month old son who didn't even understand that the ball needs to be pushed down so it would go down the looping slide. I like that my daughter gets excited when the toys makes noises, but I don't like that I have to supervise her play time with it 100%. When I go out of the room, the toy comes with me to prevent injury to my daughter. I'm really suprised the toy hasn't been pulled from the market.
__label__2 Great for "pulling up": As soon as my granddaugher began crawling, she also began to pull herself up on the furniture. I was looking for something w/out sharp edges and fairly stable that she could pull up on and not tip over very easily and discovered the Standup Ball Blaster. It works perfectly for this purpose and she loves it. Whenever she spots it, she gets a huge grin on her face and makes a beeline toward it. It holds her attention longer than any other toy so far.
__label__1 EMI both Radiated and Conducted: This switching supply generates radiated and conducted interference. I can't recommend it for powering a radio, or operating it in the vacinity of a radio. When current draw is very low, it produces 120 Hz noise also. A better design one would expect from Sony.
__label__1 Light Ballast: Can't rate item, it is not the correct item for the Lite I have. The Ballast is to large to fit in my lite even though the manufacturer/company shows this product as the product that fit my Light ficture. It was returned.
__label__2 Local Hero: Nora Roberts is a wonderful writer. Her trilogy's draw you in and keep you wanting more. I'm always looking for a Nora Roberts book I haven't read yet
__label__1 stage one of a long road of development: The Good"Radio" has a catchy chorus and memorable chord progression. "Drown" is an emotionally charged ballad with a decent chorus section. "Any Place but Here" has one of those sing-along sections that are sure to come back to you throughout the day. The heaviest riffs are delivered on "This Girl," and it's probably the most melodic track as well.The BadVocalist Sal Scoca just doesn't have it. In the immortal words on the American Idol judges, he's just too "pitchy." The music is somewhat generic as well.The VerdictCore Records pride itself on producing bands the old fashioned way; molding and developing them over a number of years. With Crashbox's latest disc, it's obvious the band is at stage one of a long road of development.
__label__1 It's OK for math, but..: I had to buy another book for Language Art. On March, my son took the writing test but with this book, he couldn't prepare for it at all.
__label__1 no t-shirt included: Very disappointed. I try to avoid plastic as much as possible. This was supposed to come with an organic cotton baby t-shirt, but instead it came with a "recycled" reusable polyester (plastic) type bag. Not interested. Detracted from the rest of the products in the box.
__label__2 Excellent!: Great flavor and texture. Can be frozen after baked. Good price. Very happy with the product. Family agrees:-) Worth a try!
__label__2 Great product: Bob's Red Hill products are not only a great value, but taste great. I have shared these with friends and they feel the same as I, a wonderful buy.
__label__1 died after 6 days: wired up the controller per instructions. worked perfect, no problems. this is on a 95 impala SS to control the factory fans, which this controller is claimed it can do. 6 days later(about 200 miles) i pull into the store and my coolant is overflowing/steaming. the fans were not on. i pulled the relay to see if it had failed and the fan controller was melted and smoking. way to make a quality product hayden. i'll never use your stuff again
__label__1 roll the dice: i bought three of these kits for three ford trucks. two of them are still working great but the one i put in my truck failed rather quickly and i didnt bother with a warranty claim, might have been a freak thing.
__label__2 K&K's pack 'n play: great addition to twin must have's, ESPECIALLY when you're first home from the hospital. my twins were preemie and not able to go into a swing or bouncer straight home from the hospital. having this in the living room has been a lifesaver. i also have a 4 year old, 3 year, and 2 year old, and this has been super easy to set the twins in when one of my other little bugs need me in a hurry. the only down fall is that it dips in the middle, causing them to roll toward the divider (a little nerve racking when your babies can't push themselves away from it . . . ). fortunately, you can lift the "mattress" and slip a couple blankets - folded flat and square - under the middle, or place their heads on the outer side so that their feet are at the divider.Good Luck!!!
__label__1 It caves in towards the center and babies roll over: I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. What they say about the center being weak is true. I have twins and they where born of 3 and 5 lbs and the bassinet started loosing its form. I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard. If I knew that was the use I was going to give it, I would have bought a cheaper one.
__label__2 Kevon Edmonds new CD is the best CD you will ever buy.: Kevon Edmonds debut solo release ''24/7'' is OUTSTANDING!!! Kevon has a soultry, sexy voice that is MESMERIZING. There are so many great tracks on his CD. A few standouts are: ''A Girl Like You'' which is a duet with his brother, Kenneth ''Babyface'' Edmonds. ''Love Will Be Waiting'' which should be the next single released from this project. ''24/7'' which is the title track and first single released from his CD. ''No Love'' which is a ballad with heart felt lyrics. Last, and certainly not least, ''Anyway'' which is an uptempo song with an awesome beat! Kevon Edmonds, ''24/7'', is a contender for ''ALBUM OF THE YEAR."
__label__2 Unexpected wording: Quick delivery. Good quality paper, but the words "Zany Brainy" are written on the paper along with "Happy Hanukah". The ad states it was made for commercial use, but doesn't say that there is a store name on it! Zany Brainy as well as Happy Hanukah are written in 1/4" purple printing.
__label__2 Tested in Patagonia: I bought to use in my adventure in Patagonia (trekings in Toores del Paine and El Chalten) with my girlfriend, and it survives all weathers (and help us survive too!).
__label__1 Might not be the best GPS system: Product worked fine and was relatively straightforward to setup. Features work as advertised although initial time required to lock onto satellites seems overly long. My primary issue is with the additional maps that are required - you need to buy both topographic and road maps [at about $100 a pop] if you plan to use offroad and on-road. Plus the topo maps are over 20 years out-of-date for my town making me wonder if they have any accuracy or relevancy at all. In retrospect, I wish I had looked more closely at the Delorme Earthmate GPS PN-20 as it comes bundled with map software that promises both up-to-date coverage of both topo and roads.
__label__1 Recevied with problem on the ON/OFF switch: I recevied the device in good packing kondtion but, when i switch it on and switch it back off i can not restart the device back antel i renstall the battery again. is there and way i can send you back the device for repair or replecment?please advice
__label__1 big price, little book: ***Buyer beware***This book (and the others in the series) sells for under $5 in JoAnne's. Amazon is ripping you off at $10. Know why it's so cheap? It's only about 30 pages, and much of the book is advertising for their products.OK, it does have some good information and helpful photos, and you can learn how to do some tricky stuff with it, but don't assume the price is right at Amazon.
__label__2 MY BALLS: MY BALLS WORK REAL WELL, THEY ARE DEFINATELY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BALLS BECAUSE THEY ARE FASTER AND FEEL LESS FRAGILE AND ARE PROFESSIONAL. I DON'T KNOW, ARE THERE BETTER BALLS THAN MY BALLS?
__label__2 Superior performance: These table tennis balls are great. As soon as I tried them you could feel the difference with other brands. It has a nice bounce and last long, and I mean long. Butterfly 3-star balls are perfect for reacreational play as well as for competitive play so if you're a beginner this is what you want to use or if you are a higher level player (intermediate to expert) these balls will get the job done. These balls are worth every cent you spend. It will be the official ball for the 2009 World Championships for one reason; they're superb!
__label__1 Proof that Brits can't rap: Some of the lyrics are funny and occasionally clever and I like the British slang, but the delivery, oh my god. No flow, no rhythm, the dude just talks in an incredibly annoying, whiny voice. And the backing tracks? The beats are less entertaining than listening to a dryer loaded with shoes. I'm afraid that Mike Skinner's rythmic sense doesn't lend itself very well to rap/hip hop. Almost all of the backing tracks are stiff and mechanical with no groove or syncopation. As with another reviewer, my initial reaction was to laugh out loud at the general awfulness of this steaming pile, but then I remembered I paid money for said pile and that killed some of the humor. This truly sucks in such novel and humorous ways that I'll give it two stars rather than one. It's just not my cuppa teenage chav crap.
__label__1 Weak: After listening to this album it seems Mike Skinner is resting on his laurels. The laurels of a great first album that had a great reception in the UK and abroad.This doesn't sound like an album that is out to prove the musical skill of the streets. This is punch the clock/satisfy the contract. It may be that as an American I'm not in touch with the current trendy sound in the UK which if this album won so much acclaim, must be stripped down simplified audio with spoken word lyrics. Not the lyrical style that was an anomaly over original beats that was truly the Original Pirate Material.I think the idea of telling a story sequentially track by track over an album is a good and original idea, but maybe the first priority should have been making good music.
__label__2 Different but good: May be hard for some to get into, but if you do, it is a joy. Not like much else.
__label__2 A welcome and invaluable compendium of sound advice: Hospital emergency rooms are typically understaffed, overstuffed, and manned with inexperienced doctors and nurses rendering them potentially hazardous to patients. This is the persuasively argued premise of Dr. Joel Cohen's ER: Enter At Your Own Risk. Dr. Cohen goes on to recommend a solid plain of action to avoid real and perceived dangers inside contemporary hospital emergency rooms that will enable non-specialist general readers on how to get treated by experts rather than the inept; how to provide children with the best care; and how to decide when and where to seek emergency professional care. ER is a welcome and invaluable compendium of sound advice in dealing with doctors and medical personnel on call so that when an emergency strikes, they will have all the facts and strategies in hand for being healed and not harmed in a hospital emergency room environment.
__label__2 Satisfaction: Enjoy a cup of this each morning. I especially appreciate that Folgers Cappuccino does not have a strong acid aftertaste. I will continue to purchase but wish the price was a bit lower.
__label__2 Simply the best instant cappuccino out there: This simply the best instant cappuccino on the market today. It beats them all. Including the instant cappuccino you get at convince stores and resturants.
__label__1 Dirty: This might have been a fun book if it had been more decent, but it just went too far. It deserves an R rating, and I find nothing at all amusing about that. I threw it in the trash before I was half done. And I won't pick up any more of Barry's fiction unless I have reason to believe it's no worse than a PG-13.
__label__1 Must have a defective unit.: I bought this radio because of the good reviews. I liked the digital tuning. It was very easy to lock on stations and the presets are also a nice feature. The sound quality was another story. Many of the other reviewers had commented on the very good sound quality, but the unit I bought sounded so bad that neither my wife, nor I could listen to it for more than a few minutes. Actually it sounded like what you would expect from such a small radio. I might have just purchased a defective unit. I just can't imagine how anyone could say my radio sounds very good or even ok. If you are thinking about buying one, check out the return policy. I sent mine back and I think I'm going to get hit with postage both ways plus a restocking fee. Ouch!
__label__1 only one speaker works on this radio: I would have been pleased with this radio since the sound is good but one of the speakers does not work. After trying four different stereo headphones, I knew for sure that only one speaker worked when using headphones. I called Sony who, after asking stern questions about how long I had the radio ( I received it from Amazon that very day!) finally told me to mail it back at my expense. I am not pleased with this situation at all. I have to wonder if Sony tested this item before it was shipped out.It would also be nice if the radio had a carrying handle and came with headphones. It would also be nice if it could run on AC/DC power.
__label__2 Portible Radio with button Like a car radio: PresetnAM FM TV stations. very easy to use. No need to look at a dial to find your favorite stations
__label__1 Good Brand, Bad Sound Quality: I Recently purchased but returned an ICF-M410V radio because the sound reproduction is low tone and muffled. Increasing the volume just distorts the sound. For me the reason is that Sony no longer manufactures this products in Japan. I own 2 of the older versions of this radio, both made in Japan, and the overall quality was excellent; sound reproduction was crisp, clear and loud. A pity because new features in the ICF-M410V radio are good improvements to the product, like the shuttle tunning knob.
__label__2 Cool product: It's all black. It's a cool alternative to the usual stainless with orange rubber reflex hammer. I'll definitely buy one another for my future practice.
__label__2 It doesn't just = popular: pop music: music of general appeal to teenagers; a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love.Pop can mean popular, but in the case of music it just means that it's just more rhytmic and less hard as rock 'n' roll. Before you go telling other people to get a brain you should check into getting that done yourself. I haven't heard this band yet but I'm trying to gather information on it to see if I would like to buy the album and people like you who complain about other people's opinions tend to get in my way, and I don't like that. So do us all a favor and shut up.
__label__2 This is just a wonderful book.: Reading is one of my greatest pleasures and a friend who knows this gave me "The Summer Guest". I was not familiar with the author and didn't know anything about the book before I began. I have since recommended this book to all of my friends. It is truly one of the best books I've read and I am a voracious reader. The language is absolutely beautiful and the characterizations are wonderful. It is a book to savor and, although I rarely reread books, I will definitely read this one again.John Citron's review from March 24, 2006 says it all. If you are in doubt about whether to purchase "The Summer Guest", do it anyway. You will not be disappointed.
__label__2 BEST cover out there!: We were looking for something to replace our old cover and found this one. It is very durable, easy to use and pretty nice looking too!
__label__2 Sony Mic is a winner!: This is an affordable microphone for students, teachers, or musicians. You can't beat the deals on Amazon for recording equipment. I use this microphone with a Sony digital recorder, and the quality is excellent for recording ensembles, groups, lectures, making personal notes, or recording on your computer directly into programs like Audacity. This is a good investment.
__label__1 work great for 2 months, not any more: Bought this to use with ZI8 and it worked great for about 2 months. After 2 months, I noticed that the sound playback was at a very low volume. Unfortunately, these low volume recordings were very important events, and I'm disappointed that the audio isn't good. I've tested the ZI8 with a different stereo mic and that works, so I know the problem isn't with the ZI8. Reseller has a 30 return policy and Sony's is only 90 days. Very disappointed this didn't last. I took the mic apart and the noticed the low quality soldering for one of the mics. The GND is shorted the White wire on the Right mic. This can't be correct? The PADs are very close together and I can't seem to remove enough solder to separate these PADS so that they aren't shorted. Wish I had a schematic of this board.
__label__1 Is this a joke? Overpriced above Sony's list price?: Amazon has to watch out their partners. There are many trying to fish in rough waters. How is it possible that this item is fluctuating from $60 to beyond $100 when the listed suggested price in Sony's page is $75?Please Amazon: In order to improve your services which are already very good, you need to tie down these opportunists and not let them to ask for prices beyond listed.
__label__1 I wasted my money on this item from Amazon: I bought this item to go with a Z10 Touch Video. It was recommended on Amazon and said it went well with this kind of camera. I bought it new. However, I didn't get to test it until a couple of months later, too late to return it. When I tried it, it did not work at all, despite following the directions. I got worse sound than if I used the camera without it. Now I'm stuck with a defective product. What a waste of resources!!!
__label__2 Toshiba DVD: We just returned from Disney, having flown 2.5 hours each way with a 3 yr old and a 6 yr old. The portable DVD was a life-saver, particularly for my little one. Not only is the picture incredible, the battery held its charge for at least 4 hours! Our Panasonic doesn't come close to the quality of this unit! A must have - easy to use as well.
__label__1 My Husband's Affair Became the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me: The price of this book is way too high for the type of book it is. A more reasonable price would be $9.99.
__label__1 Heart concerns? Stay away from this one.: If you have heart problems, stay away from this one!! After taking it for little more than a week, I was hospitalized for atrial fibrillation. No serious damage to my heart, but the co-pay on the bill was substantial. to be fair, this product did NOT cause the afib as it was a preexisting condition.Quinine is the cause of the problem but quinine is used to fight malaria. btw, I still experienced leg cramps.
__label__2 leg cramps: This is an excellent product that stops my leg cramps within 10 seconds of putting the tablet under my tongue. Delivery of the product was extremely fast to HI.
__label__1 More trouble than its worth.: I love the concept, but in practice I find that it is not as useful as you'd think. If you are not careful to keep the remote pointed at the 'system' for several seconds after issuing a command all the settings will not be executed. The remote does provide a 'help' function the steps you through the settings to correct the errors. However, this seems to happen so often that I end up using the original remotes anyhow. The remote is also a little too small and I find it difficult to hit all the buttons on the top and the side without dropping it.
__label__2 Ham Radio for Dummies Useful To Already Licensed Amateur Operators: I earned my Extra class license within one year of beginning the process. I own or have studied the classic ARRL library of amateur radio handbooks. But this Dummies edition says it all in ways that are easier to understand and that point the reader to additional, more detailed sources. I also purchased a second copy for my 15 year old grand son who is working on Eagle Scout and who will take a scouting class in amateur radio with his scout troop. Ham Radio for Dummies provides a medium for technical conversation between my grand son and me. If he remains interested, he will have my equipment and call sign for his own.
__label__2 Very good primer: I bought this book just to see if ham was something I'd be interested in as a hobby. After reading this, and the technician licensing book put out by the ARRL, I had no problem passing my first exam and getting my license. The author also gives many website links throughout the text that are helpful in finding more free information.Overall though, I'd say this is a good starter book, if you just want to find out what amateur radio is all about.
__label__1 Not What I Expected At All: These are hits by the original artists but they are not the songs as you heard them on the radio or on other albums (studio versions) and so they are not the way you remember them. I suppose if you are a frequent concert goer and are accustomed to your favorite songs sounding quite different from the "album" or "released" version, you won't be bothered by this. I think this set would have been more aptly named: "Rock N Roll of the 70s - And Everyone Is On A Comeback Tour" or "Rock N Roll of the 70s - And Here's What We Sound Like Today" or something like that. Overall, I was very disappointed.Rock N Roll of the 70s
__label__1 Ouch!: Horrible recording quality, not the original, single versions...Buy the Billboard series instead.
__label__2 Folgers Cappuccino Mocha Mix: I have used this product for a couple year now and love it. In fact, instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with my coffee in the morning and enjoy it more then the mocha's I was getting at well-known coffee places. I used to by this product at a couple stores who longer carry it, which was really frustrating. Being able to buy it online is great!
__label__1 Ridiculously expensive: I love this coffee and have been drinking it for many years. While it is getting impossible to find at stores around where I live, I would never dream of spending this kind of money for 6 cans. My Lord, the most expensive place sells this for $4.02 a can. Why would you spend twice that amount here?? Crazy!! If you all have lots of disposable income, I can send you a list of some good causes that need your money more than these sellers who are ripping you off.
__label__1 Quite a Disappointment: I bought this item after searching for quite some time to find a copy of the original off-Broadway cast album. While anticipating that this version would differ from the album I really wanted, I was rather dismayed to find that it is in all respects quite inferior. In my mind, the main problem lies with the choice of Diane Langton for the female lead. Her voice, while pleasant enough, is a poor substitute for Gretchen Cryer's. Add to that some questionable directorial choices (the a capella version of "Lonely Lady") and you have a less-than-mediocre product.
__label__2 Older version: This is an older version of the power supply. While it is totally compatable, the cable coming from the transfomer to the plug is a smaller gauge wire. I needed a replacement quickly and this served the purpose.
__label__2 Used with 1st gen BP200 (made in 2002): This is much better built than the adapter that came with my BP200. I was able to fix the original adapter though, so I plan on using the new one outside of my house. The new version doesn't get as warm as the old one after several hours of use. Using thicker wire helps with that.I found it at a great price, so I opted for the expedited delivery to get the thing on my hands quickly.
__label__1 Worst of three Glacier hike books: This one seemed like the friendliest and easiest to use, but it ended up being the most inaccurate, the worst organized, and the most incomplete. For example, one famous trail was described as "easy" and "7.5 miles round trip." In fact, it was 15 miles round trip; and describing 15 miles in any terrain, much less an alpine one, as 'easy' is a curious choice, and one I found myself grumbling about several times around miles 11 and 12.Erik Molvar's book proved to be far more trustworthy.
__label__2 Glacier Day Hikes - Two Thumbs Up!: This book was right on the money as far as how to find the trail head, the length and difficulty of a trail and estimated time on the trail. It describes not only the destination, but what you'll experience along the way. The photos are great, but don't do justice to actually being there.
__label__2 Simple way to describe feelings to a little one.: My 5 and 3 year old love this book therefore I love it also. It is very simple with great artwork. I would recommend it to someone who is trying to teach a little one how to use words for emotions. My girls also like trying to make the faces.
__label__2 Memories with my son reading together-Worth the money: I heard about this book while watching TV one day. I decided to purchase it. It's great. It's not too long and not too short. Easy to read. My son is 3 years old and is saying the words along with me. Words like HAPPY, DISAPPOINTED, FRUSTRATED, JEALOUS, SILLY, SCARED, BORED. It's really a great book and worth more than what I paid. The memories will last a life time.
__label__2 Wonderful, inspiring, emotional, colorful illustrations!: I saw this book recently at a neighborhood bookstore and I fell in love with the illustrations recently. (Another reviewer) said that these characters were "cold" but I completely disagree. They are full of life, exuberance and fun, perfect for young children to identify with and express how they feel.This book is a delight and I'll be giving it to a few children for Christmas!
__label__2 Love it!: The beautiful illustrations are tons of fun & the words are wonderful! I brought this book for my 5 yr old who we adopted and 3 1/2 and has all sort of feelings he usually acts out on. The book gave us a way to discuss recognizing and articulating feelings, and how to deal with them in an appropriate ways.
__label__1 Just didn't resonate with me: I found very little "warrior" about this book unless you mean the stealth, meditating warrior within. Don't get me wrong, there are some really, REALLY good meditation exercises, but I found this book just scratching a surface and not "meaty" enough. I also found some of his ideas hard to grasp (five sided pyramid? It took me several minutes to realize that they only way that could be done is to lop off the top so there would then be a flat part & you could have that be a side...he never explains this) and he was extremely redundant. Also, his habit of summarizing every chapter at the end was very annoying - it reminded me of textbooks from school. I really loved his first book and have great admiration & respect for Mr. Cuhulain, but this book was just not my cup of tea. Wiccan, yes...but largely I felt more into Eastern Meditation & metaphysical concepts.
__label__2 Wickedly Funny....: J.P. Donleavy's manual for social climbers is the most amusingly cynical book I've ever read. Though addressed to the modern parvenu, the author uses pseudo-18th century language to satirize social pretensions, instructing the reader on how to behave in every context, what to wear, what home to inhabit, how to deal with neighbors, whom to flatter and whom to disdain. My favorite entry: "Upon the Pointy Two-Tone Shoe."
__label__1 won't drink the coolaid twice: Have the same problems with the VAIO latop battery, it just stopped working (the battery with the original laptop purchase). Logged on to Amazon with the intent to buy a new one, but was a) outraged by the price ($200 is 1/5 of the way toward a new laptop), b) convinced by the other reviews in this page that I would buy a battery with, likely, the same problems and life.Thanks, all, for putting in your prior reviews on the Sony Battery...
__label__1 Hurts your laptop's value: This is a terrible battery. Mine now loses its recharge in about 15 minutes. I was so frustrated to discover the poor quality of this battery, and to realize that I don't have a laptop anymore, I have a paperweight. Shame on Sony, who sit by quietly and don't try to make amends to the owners of these batteries. I have already seen other, smaller quality problems with other Sony products, but now, for sure I won't be buying any Sony product again for fear of the little surprises like this that can skunk my investment.
__label__2 Remarkably easy to use: This small book is easy to understand and easy to use. This system of divination is based in Tibetan Buddisum but anyone can easily apply the fundamentals. You begin by asking for guidance in what to use, and what to discard in the reference material. You begin by quieting your mind, chants are provided for focus. You select a question you wish to ask, you then roll a single dice twice. You may caste the dice for yourself, or another. You record the number rolled on each throw, and look up those combinations in the reference. A wide range of areas (family, goals, business, money, health, etc. - 10 in all) are covered for each combination, providing a "general climate" (positive/neutral/negative) for the current personal and earth energies occuring at that moment in time. While my copy came with a traditional dice, any traditional six sided dice can be used. Personal experince has found the method informative and useful.
__label__2 a camcorder will actually carry and use regularly: After having used full-size Vhs camcorder then Hi-8, it is a pleasure to carry and use this unit. I looked at all of the new breed of digital units and chose this one. It is easier to hold and use than the PC-1 or the Elura and it has a larger screen on the side and takes Sony's new Memory stick. I am very pleased, this one won't sit in my closet waiting gor absolute special events.
__label__1 Best of the Isley Brothers: Not what I expected! The song selection look good, however the product menu would not let you sample the songs. The CD cover shows front & back. If you could magnify the back cover so you could read the information, you would fine every song has some Rap/Hip Hop artist talking over the Isley Brothers' songs. This was not in the product description or I wouldn't have purchased it. This is the most horrendous CD I have ever encountered and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
__label__2 A gentler side of Beethoven.: For the most part, this is a very nice CD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because a couple of pieces had poor recording quality. I could hear background noise. Perhaps they were live recordings. Still, a nice CD overall. I like this softer more gentle side of Beethoven. Very beautiful and enjoyable.
__label__2 Works well: This fan replaced 2 smaller fans on my custom 1980 Turbo Crolla that I thought would have been better. To my surprise, I was wrong. This is a great fan. My overheating days are over. Great fan for the price.
__label__1 Not real great: Aside from the competent performances of Douglas Jimerson and Jill Worley, the singers and musicians on this CD are rather poor. But the recording is worse - poor quality, and done in such a way as to emphasize defects in the presentation. Whenever David Calib comes in with the drums, everything else is drowned out. Did they put the mike _in_ the drum? Sounds like it. The best numbers were those with Jimerson soloing with only a piano backup. It was therefore very disappointing to hear "All Quiet Along the Potomac" as a trumpet/drum instrumental. All this is not to mention the quibble that the album's connection with Robert E. Lee is a bit strained. Aside from "How Firm a Foundation," most of the songs have very little to do with Lee aside from the fact that his family might conceivably have had the sheet music lying around the house, or they were popular during/after the wars he took part in. Be that as it may, I'm sorry to say that three-quarters of the CD is barely listenable.
__label__1 BEWARE: NOT ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL AND GUITAR WHEN YOU USE THE HANGERS. WILL CAUSE THE GUITAR TO HIT WALL EACH TIME YOU USE IT. UNLESS YOU TAKE YOU TIME AND ENSURE THAT THE GUITAR IS IN THE RIGHT POSITION AND THERE IS MINIMUM MOVEMENT. FINDING STUDS IN THE WALL CAN ALSO BE AN ISSUE. IF YOU DON'T SCREW IT INTO THE STUD THE UNIT MIGHT NOT BE SECURE ENOUGH.I WENT WITH THE HERCULES TRI STAND AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.
__label__2 Great Product: These look great hanging on the wall and hold my guitars well. I bought too of them and have been impressed. They are adjustable and do what they claim.
__label__2 Just fine: Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.
__label__2 nice product: Nice looking. kind of like buying a happy meal, the surprise is the seeing which one is inside. the color and style is a crap shoot. i wanted oak but got maple. might buy 5 hoping one is the color i want then return the rest. The price was great i shopped around and could not find anything cheaper. holds up well. I got all the peices and screws. does look nice. small enough the color probably wont mater.
__label__2 It is easy to install and priced right: There is not a whole lot to say about this guitar hanger, but it sure is nice to have the guitar off the floor and easily accessible. I'm really glad I bought this.
__label__2 String Swing Guitar hanger: My husband ordered 4 of these. I know that the discription says "shades may vary"...we got 3 in a light walnut shade and 1 of them was a dark brown. You would think that if its all the same order then they would send all one color. Oh well. When all the guitars are hung up you can hardly tell. It was really easy to install and they look great.
__label__2 Cheaper than Guitar center! Sort of...: Ordered these to get a couple of my guitars out of the corner of my room. They took a little longer than I hoped to arrive, but not much. Easy to install if you have a drill/driver. Worked perfect for my needs. I have bought them from Guitar Center before and unless they are on sale they are generally $5 more there. Very happy with my purchase.
__label__1 A few lost cities and a lot of rubbish: I read this looking for more information on the various sites but was greatly disappointed. There is some description of several sites along with a lot of wild speculation and questionable history. About a third way through the book changes into an wandering very stupid hitch hiking travelogue of South America. Describing how he got lucky with a girl in a bar is not a monumental event.A sorry waste of time and money.
__label__2 Outstanding!: Love this toothpaste. It's a natural product, and helps improve gum disease. I've struggled with slight gum irritationg for a couple of years and Thieves toothpate combined with the Thieves mouthwash has improved my gums. As a diabetec good oral hygene is critical.
__label__2 easy, interesting read: As an avid student of Native American history, I found this to be a fine "sitting by the fire" read. It contained enough technical info to keep it from being simplistic and tied together a lot of emerging information about the possible settling of the new world by sea. This area of great conflict among archaeologists deserves a lot more study than it is currently getting. Hopefully, this volumn will direct the interest of more people in this direction.My five-star rating is based on this being a very interesting book on it's own to many people without extensive knowlege in the field, not to be compared with more technical volumes directed more toward hard-core professionals or academics.I only wish there had been more photos, clearer photos and photos of artifacts, work sites and locations mentioned in the text rather than of people standing around.
__label__1 More an Autobiographical Account than Support of a Theory: Mr. Koppel is a skillfull prose writer, but the facts, theories and evidence in his book are interspersed few and far between. This makes it easy and fun to read, but left me starving for the archeological meat and potatoes that I had bought the book for in the first place.So, to those who enjoy reading themselves to sleep to well-written travel narratives with stories of mild adventure, I do recommend "Lost World". But, those just interested in a fact-filled presentation of the "before Clovis, by boat" theory of the peopling of the Americas and its supporting evidences will likely be disappointed with this book. To them I recommend instead the book "Bones, Boats and Bison."
__label__1 not properly packaged- cannot use: This cart comes without any protective packaging (it's sent in a cardboard box that fits the folded cart exactly- no padding, no protective layer, not even any sturdy cardboard corners to keep the flimsy box from collapsing), so of course it is bent when it arrives and you can't use it. If it had arrived in good condition, it probably would have been a decent cart, but I wouldn't take my chances on that (am ordering a replacement from a different company).
__label__1 bummer: Looks great, wonderful size, perfect if it only stayed together... worked for a few days before the front wheels fell off and a few weeks before the rear wheels fell off.
__label__1 Not authors: A choice excerpt:"The best way to start writing a class is to decide what you want it to do. For this, a Python-based modelof refrigerator behaviors, Fridge, is the first thing, and it should be basic. While you're thinking aboutit, focus on what you will need a particular Fridge object to do for your own purposes. You wantenough behaviors available that this object can be used to make food, yet you don't want to worry aboutaspects of real-life refrigerators that won't be included in a simplified example, such as temperature, thefreezer, defrosting, and electricity--all of these are unnecessary details that would only complicate ourpurpose here. For now, let's just add to the docstring for the Fridge class to define the behaviors thatyou will be building soon."Did an editor even look at this?
__label__1 below average book: The book is very annoying, actually i found the style of the authors rather heavy,easy topics are explained difficult to understand, which shows the luck of experience in writing technical books.This actually should be the difference between an Internet tutorial and a book.
__label__2 Masque: I really appreciate Andrea Kane's writing style. Her stories are colorful and very realistic. She keeps the stories rolling along with her wit and humor.One "little deception" can land a Duke in the Parson's Trap quicker than steamy kisses with a beautiful virgin.
__label__1 No manual and no markings.... Can't install: The gauge came with no manual and no markings on the back to tell you what wire goes where.The oil pressure gauge has 3 bolts for wires. I know from my previous gauge that the middle one is to the oil pressure sending unit, but the left and right ones can be either negative or positive. Since I've already blown one because mine wasn't stock and the positive and negative were reversed, I don't want to hook this up until I know what goes where. How hard would it be to mark the back of the gauge for easy hookup?
__label__1 looks good doesn't last long: really liked the styling of this toaster and the reviews were good, but the reviews that were bad for this product are what I should have listened to. after only a few months the spring in the left side started getting weak and would not return the waffles all the way up. I then started using the right side and it has been better, but alas the spring in that side is weak as well. besides that the toasting quality is good but not returning the waffles back up thing is essential to my toasting of anything.
__label__1 Disappointing: THis book doesn't really offer information for doing a brunch. It has a limited amount of recipes. Some of them are as obvious as adding fruit and milk to store purchased granola. Or ones like adding icecream to coffee. There are much better breakfast books and brunch information than this book.
__label__2 Entertaining and Enlightening: You will be hard pressed to find a better work of historical fiction than the "Siege of Krishnapur." Mr. Farrell does an exceptional job of conveying both the horror and the farce that defined the Indian Mutiny. He skewers the British for their imperialistic follies and myopic ambitions, and he does so in an understated and droll manner that will frequently cause you to chuckle. Both the characters and the plot are expertly developed, and the combat scenes will have you turning the pages faster than you can imagine. Highly recommended.
__label__1 More like a prelude: I read 38% into the book without getting to anything about the actual siege. The book should be rename to something like Prelude and Events leading up to the siege of...
__label__1 The Ant No-No: It was hard for my kids to learn how to do. When they learn how to play the game, it was not fun anymore.
__label__2 Completing the line: It is not really a text book to study taiji in sense of a modern book. But it is a good summary of its predecessors. It collects some missing translations, sums up older books, adds details and so on. Not a required reading but a standard part in each Taijiquan Collection in your book shelf esp if you are interested in the Yang family style.
__label__2 Total agree: The Second cd is best, Mixed very well, good, dark, hard, I paid 25 for it at a local shop, soo I was dissappointed at first, I honestly dont even touch the first cd after I listened to it, unless to mix. The second is the mixed version with a few extras. I like it for the most, I love a few songs a lot... good addition for the used price!
__label__2 Great Convenient Bag: I live in NYC and this bag is great to carry or stroll on the trains. I've pulled this bag through rain and snow and it's durable and sturdy. I like the fact the bag can fold which is better than those other shopping bags with wheels that don't. I wish the handles were a bit longer, but other than that it's what I was looking for.
__label__2 folding shopping bag: This is the second of this product we have. We keep one in each vehicle to use when shopping, and they come in very handy, especially due to the folding wheels.
__label__2 A page turner: This was a very good book. In this book Luke got to see the world outside his farm and school and see what is like to be a baron. Sometimes I got confused reading this about why Luke thought someone was right or wrong but overall this book was intreging and suspenseful. I recommend it to anyone who liked the last three books.
__label__2 YOU GO HADDIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Wow words cannot even describe how great and captivating this book is. It keeps you guessing the whole way through. A good book should be a thrill ride and this was!!!!! I mean hey wat r u doing still at your desk reading this get out and Buy It NOW!!!!!!
__label__1 It works, but the gas is horrible: I suffer from occasional problems with being regular, so I've been enjoying the yogurt which works fine. I wanted to get rid of the calories, so I tried this.There's no doubt that it works, but THE GAS is horrible. This is my 10th day and it has NOT gone away. I'm giving it only 12 days, then I have to quit because it's just awful.The product does work, but the side effects...yikes!
__label__2 Good stuff: Probiotics are a life saver for those of us with IBS. I think one pill a week is enough though I don't need to reestablish the little bug colony more than that. I love this product.
__label__2 Gene Hackman: Exciting Western. Gene Hackman plays a great bad-guy. Russell Crowe and Gary Sinese are good on the eyes as is Sharon Stone.
__label__1 can't believe this is a Bob's Red Mill product: Normally I love the Bob's Red Mill products, but I made this one, had a couple slices from it and ended up throwing it out. It came out hard and barely tasted like cinnamon raisin. I would recommend a bunch of their other products (especially the pizza mix) but I would advice against buying the cinnamon raisin bread mix.
__label__1 They forgot the salt: I like low salt, lite salt no salt. So if I am complaining about a lack of salt they forgot the salt in the batch I bought. Texture was fine flavor was BLAH.
__label__1 printable not wearable: My first black and color cartridge was fine and worked okay (did run out of ink slightly faster than I anticipated). When I opened the next black cartridge package ink poured out of package and all over my shirt and jeans. The same happened with the next color cartridge. I have seen better deals, but I figured you get what you pay for. Not in this case. It cost me the price of this product and two pairs of jeans and two shirts. Not really worth it.
__label__2 Great But Flawed: I loved this book, the author was really insightful with the episodes he chose to review, the non-episode articles are also intelligantly written, often humerous and enjoyable. Where I think the book fails is that it doesn't cover the whole of seaon 8/9, only selected episodes, the episode in which Mulder appears. This is because the book has a shipper heart through and through and is intent on covering the Mulder and Scully relationship. Fair enough but I would have loved to see what the author thought of more non-shipper episodes. It isn't very comprehensive in that regard but still a good read.
__label__2 Yes!: Yes! Another great find among all the bland crap that is passed off as good crime writing. This guy is another killer with a keyboard.
__label__2 Interesting but a downer....: A pretty good first novel but what a grim view of a side of life I am glad I not involved in. Compelling and strange with a resolution that seemed too pat. It was hard to put down although. :)
__label__1 Interesting raw material in dire need of editing: I don't mind music that stretches my attention span. After a few listens, it might even grow on me. I might detect new subtleties that bring color to what seemed like a bleak landscape at first. Laibach demands that kind of long-term relationship from the listener. However, there's a difference between daring minimalism and simple laziness. This album may have interesting moments, but the moments are not fused into interesting songs. It's a good novel that skipped the editing stage and sailed directly to the bookshelf. Furthermore, the endearing croak of Laibach's lead singer is absent, further alienating a Laibach stalwart like me. Oh well. I listen to this one in the background when I'm cooking sometimes. I stop clanging the dishes when I know a good passage is coming. I wouldn't even consider using other Laibach stuff as "background" music.
__label__1 If you are sanding this mask is almost useless: This mask, although capturing small particle if they are actually attempted to be sucked in through the mask would work great. However, with only one strap it does not form a tight seal, so dust is sucked in around the edges.I just finished trying it for an hour of sanding with 80 grit and although I was sure to make it fit as well as possible I'm still coughing up dust.
__label__2 What Level Am I?: All I can say is the game is really(2x) great its interesting and very, very exciting. But I guess the game is too short for the players to reach their maximum level of 30, you could finish the game without even getting close to it. Please try to work on this...Thanks.
__label__1 Doesn't live up to the standard of the original or BG2.: This was one of the more expensive expansion packs I've ever seen, but sadly, it was also one of the shortest. Though the story of the game is okay, there is really not much new for this, other then the graphical enhancements made in Baldur's Gate 2 that they back ported to IWD. The new monsters (actually new, not old ones with a new skin) can be counted on one hand, and other then one of them - the final boss, they are kind of boring. Unless you have money to burn, this game should be passed on...
__label__2 Wonderful: Truly a amazing CD!!! This is the first time I bought this artist CD and I became a instant fan. She is truly anointed by God a must hear!!!
__label__2 Easy and thoroughly enjoyable read: I picked up this book while working our school library's Scholastic Book Sale fundraiser. I was looking for something I could pick up and put down in between customers. Unfortunately, I couldn't put the book down. I am not a good reader, usually lean towards books with short chapters and rarely finish any book. I finished this book so quickly I was shocked and sad when the last chapter came to an end.I am not an educator but I am a parent of a very intellectual 3rd grader. He has a male teacher this year for the first time and I read a few passages from your book. He laughed so hard his mouth hurt. I thanked Mr. Done for giving parents a peek-a-boo view into the lives of our kids and the teachers who spend their days with them.It was thoroughly entertaining and enlightening.
__label__2 Love it!: After downloading this cd on a music site i wont mention a few months ago which didnt have all the bonus track on it like this one does. I broke down and bought this one. There is many good songs on here including some of the bonus tracks. There is only a couple weak songs but overall a very good cd to have. When i bought the cd a week and half ago it was 12.99. Now i see Amazon is raising price again. I dont understand why all these old cds arent cheaper, remastered or not i usually dont like to spend more then 10 bucks on a cd. I would like to get maybe her first cd to, but now i see Amazon has raised the price to over 14 bucks! CRAZY!!
__label__2 Back in time: It's just like a dear old friend is back in my life. I realized that Lisa Hartman was a part of my youth (especially during her time on "Knots Landing" from 1982-86).I knew this perticular album before, I still must have the LP somewhere...Lisas singing skills are improved since her first album- any song on that album is perfectly performed. It is such a shame that Lisa didn't get more credit as a singer. I know that she is doing country music with her husband today- but what about doing a musical like "Annie get your gun" or "Tommy" on Broadway?The selection of bonus tracks is superbly chosen what made me giving that re-release the highest ratings possible.
__label__2 Cookbook: My mother had this. I got this one as a present. It's got all the 'old-world' recipes. I haven't tried them all, but it's got what I want.
__label__2 Looks like Darth Vader bust: I have this on my desk at work and always get compliments on it. I've had it for over 10 years and it still looks fantastic. Easy to put together and very durable. Great for any Sith.
__label__1 Instant beverage coaster...simply awful.: BUYER BEWARE! Based on all the positive reviews of this album, I decided to jump in and try it. I was terribly disappointed. This is just a bunch of blips and beeps that sound like they came right out of a Casio keyboard with what sounds like Japanese girls yelling "We love dancing! Yay!" over and over again. The music is totally inane, riddiculous, uninventive, unappealing, non-melodic, and tiresome. It remids me of a soundtrack to a second rate Japanese childrens' video game. Even if you can get into the kitsch appeal of this release more than I could, I highly doubt this is a title that will stand up to repeated listening. I have an extensive music collection of over six-thousand CD's spanning nearly every genre, and this one honestly rates among the worst I have ever purchased. Pass on this one!
__label__2 An invaluable help: Noel Hume compiled this wonderful treasury of ceramics mostly from his personal collection. This book is invaluable in my Colonial Archaeology class. Even if you are midly interested in ceramics, this beautifully illustrated book is an easy read, and very informative.
__label__1 Let Down once again!: My favorite Jet is an F/A-18 E Super Hornet! But i was hoping that Digital Integration would have done more than creat a game with only good ideas.Graphics are poor period!I have read the readme file and tried to slow down features on a already poor graphics situation and it still locks up sooner or later!I'm running a G-Force II with an Intel Pentium III and a Full Sound Blaster Live. I have no problems with any of my other games.If only they would have made this NAVY Flight sim as good as Falcon 4.0.As far as the Hornet world is concerned,"Janes" still is number one!This game is a bummer and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since the company couldn't write the program to make it worth much!Marc :[
__label__1 F/A-18E Super Hornet Gold: The only "Gold" in this sim is in the title. I had to look at the CD twice to make certain I hadn't loaded the first version in error. Shame on them for charging this much money for nothing more than a campaign upgrade, to an already poor sim. I do not recommend this sim to anyone. Save your money.
__label__2 Awesome product..must have: I must honestly say this product is very absorbent better thank anything I ever tried I would definitely recommend this item,,,I am a critic but this guzzler works you won't regret and the custome service is on point...I must say they take there product and services into consideration ...and what customers think of them...kudos
__label__2 AWESOME SWING: I SO LOVE THIS SWING! MY 16 YEAR OLD SON STAINED AND SEALED IT AFTER MY HUSBAND PUT IT TOGETHER. THE HUSBAND HUNG IT AT THE WRONG ANGLE, SO WHEN HE WENT OUT OF TOWN, I FIXED THE ANGLE MYSELF...LOVE IT. YOU WILL TOO. JUST BE SURE TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE OF THE ANGLE BEFORE YOU HANG IT. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT CLEAR ON THIS MATTER.
__label__1 Poor content. Not for flowershop owners: If you are a flowershop owner and searching for a variety of fresh ideas for your clients this is not the appropiate book. It has a few nice photos but they are scarce. Definitely not worth it.
__label__2 Better than Country Boy Records: Man , this Raiheim CD , is way better than anything Thugged Out's ever came out with (plus better than Contry Boy, although he disses them throughout the CD), especially now that they are nation wide with their new Distribution deal w/ Orchard. I havent bought it yet but I listened to it , and if you havent you need to.
__label__1 It is okay: It was not as I expected. It is okay, dont' think I would of bought it had I known what it was really like, but it is okay.
__label__2 Brilliant work...: If you are interested in deepening in Israel archaeology then this encyclopedia it is highly recommended, however there is a 5th volume with more up dates that you should probably get through the publishers...
__label__1 WHO TAUGHT THIS DUMB ASS HOW TO TYPE!!!!!!: The author of this book Michael Lane must have been taught how to spell by his son. this stupid son of a bitch mispelled every word in the book. I can understand why he is so dumb mostly because he is crippled, but the fact the books sounds like it was made by the power rangers makes me think this guy is the next michael jackson. in all if you buy this book you are aiding terrorism, and if you read it you are just making yourself that much dumber. SO PLEASE DON'T BUY AND READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I know the truth about BRETT FARVE FANATIC!: This BrettFavrefanatic is none other than the sick son of a bitch author Michael Lane. He has ruined his credibility because he has been charged with 18 accounts of child molestation and tells about his accounts of raping the kids in his book. Do not read this book FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY!!
__label__2 I LOVED IT.: Lynn Johnston is my favorite comic strip writer/artist, and FBOW is my favorite comic strip. Highlights of this edition include Michael's graduation,Gordon and Tracey's engagement and the death of Farley,which is truly moving.
__label__2 Great book!: I probably pronounced every name in this book incorrectly but the kids still love it! Great for pre-k to younger elementary children, the book is a perfect way to introduce the Savannah habitat and get some counting practice in as well.
__label__2 Highly recommended: An extremely humorous, and yet truthful book. Not only does Zahavi accurately portray the female psyche, but also helps express the feelings, and emotions of anyone who has ever been pushed too far, and has finally said - enough is enough ...
__label__2 Very awesome product: Love how soft this makes the skin feel, it is sticky but then just absorbs nicely into skin. I use regularly.
__label__1 Messy!: I didn't even use this product long enough to see if it even worked b/c the graphics on the bottle come off if you get even the smallest amount of oil on it and it gets all over EVERYTHING. Was not worth using again after all the mess.
__label__2 Well organized presentation with detailed information: The New Rose Expert divides roses by hybrid tea, floribunda, patio, miniature, ground cover, climber & rambler and shrub with small labels at the bottom of each category for quick location and each rose is presented with beautiful photo, general description, and the specifics: blooms, foiliage, health, and awards for efficient comparisons. In depth coverage of planting, care and propagation with pointers for the novus are included. I especially liked the guides to selection of roses depending on the fragrance, color and proposed use (ground cover, climber, etc). An excellent primer!
__label__2 lOADED with information: I am just beginning to grow roses and have read many books. This has it all and I like the format.
__label__1 Not a good Disney movie: I usually like Disney movies. They are simple, colorful, delivers a good message and it is mindless TV for about an hour and a half. When I started watching Cow Girls, this is what I was expecting. The movie is about two girls who have to work at their father's dairy company and must soon save the company when things start to go wrong. The movie was awful; it had bad acting, bad, super super bad dialogue, cliché scenes (but to the extreme) and it was just bad in general. Did anyone bother to call the police when the guy stole the money?!My major issue with the movie is the dialogue, it was pathetic. Alyson and Amanda Michalka are not amazing actresses, but they are not that horrible. But, the script in this movie makes their acting horrible. I'd rather watchZenon: Girl of 21st Century,Cadet KellyorHigh School Musical (Two-Disc Remix Edition). This movie was really bad and I was appalled that it made it to the TV screen.
__label__1 Not one of their best DVDs: I was a bit disappointed with this new release. The beach background and the music were distracting and the exercises were not as well designed as in their other DVDs. I am a fan of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh. A month after I started the Fat Free Yoga DVD, I withdrew my gym membership and did yoga only. I own several of their DVDs and I rotate them in the course of a week. Overall, I feel healthier, happier, sleep better, and I even like myself better. My favorite DVDs are Lose Weight & Feel Great, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Cleanse.
__label__2 My favorite of the new trio!: Ana and Ravi's Stretch, Strengthen and Be Stress Free is my favorite of their new trio. I am an advanced beginner exerciser and I do a full hour of this whenever I use it, which is often. I find it feels wonderful on my back, especially since I have a tendency to tighten up there or strain it a bit when doing other workouts. I also love the hip opening sequence. This DVD has, in my opinion, the best back and leg stretches of any of their workouts.Since using Raviana's tapes, I have lost 12+ pounds and am on my way to a new body!Another thing I love about this tape - and their others - is that there is no endless sequence of Sun Salutations. The moves are unique but focused, and I never look at the clock while doing these!
__label__2 An Awesome Recording: I saw Jim Black perform some years ago with sax-player Assif Tsahar and violinist Mat Maneri, and he absolutely blew me away. When I found out that he had his own band I immediately rushed out to get this CD, and I wasn't disappointed. While it obviously owes a great deal to free jazz, that's only one point of departure. If you could imagine free jazz spiced with ambient, heavy metal, Morphine and "Moving Pictures"-era Rush, it would probably sound something like this.
__label__2 Great Details!: Love all the extras in this book. Some of the information is not as up to date as I would like or are not always backed by scientific evidence (seems like a "must" to me in a high school biology book!)For example, "the day has come when we are now able to produce new living things" you have seen this on TV. Since when does TV become solid evidence to support a statement!) I prefer true scientific studies that have used the scientific method to come to their conclusions. This is getting picky, because I appreciate the drawings, photos, extra study hints (especially in the teacher's edition) and the web pages that are suggested- done by Prentice-Hall.
__label__2 Another excellent track from Rage: This track totally kix ***! Rage is the real thing, Kid Rock, Korn, Limp Bizkit are *** compared to rage. Tom's at it again with an amazing solo, it sounds like a harmonica which gives the song a wierd feel to it. If you ask me that solo sounds like some techno square dancing tune, either way the track is awesome. This single will make you say turn that *** up!!
__label__2 This song rocks! Rage has come back strong and hard.: You need to listen to this song. The new album, The Battle of Los Angeles, comes to stores November 2, 1999.
__label__2 They've delivered once again!: This song is really fantastic and is one of their better songs already. This song REALLY gets me psyched for their new CD. I mean, when I first heard "The Ghost of Tom Joad" on the video, I knew they were still writing great material, and another great song like this proves they haven't lost any of their energy! Could "The Battle of Los Angeles" be the rightful heir to the self-titled Rage CD ?(Don't get me wrong, I love Evil Empire, but compared to the first one...) With two great songs recently written by them, one of which is on the new CD, my hopes are high!
__label__2 History made entertaining: It was the showtime series on the Borgia's that got me interested in this book. I found the information to be enlightening. When I was a youth, I found history boring. It was decades later before I found books that were not dry, that gave a clear view of life during the period of time being reviewed. Gregorovius does a good job of making this a very readable piece of history. It's full of unbiased information from validated sources. Truth is more interesting and sometimes stranger than fiction. It gave me an entirely different view of Lucretia Borgia from the view I had developed watching the popular series on TV. Worth the read.
__label__1 Bad Grammar, Bad info, Bad book: This book is the epitome of what a sports book shouldn't be. Mythical stats are surrounded by poor grammar that's hard to read and follow. The highlight of the book is truly it's first chapter on the first game ever. Unfortunately, the book goes down from there.
__label__2 Professor as Madonna, or Madonna as Professor?: Professora Paglia is interesting! A lesbian who likes sex with men. A former (?) Catholic so steeped in the puritanism that she lambasts that she has trouble with sex. She predates the Sokal hoax in attacking the nonsense called poststructuralism and other hardly-baked "ideas" of postmodernism. She deserves credit for that. Without PC, in the form of the sexual harrassment laws, Mr. Starr would have remained only the boring, unknown, fundamentalist lawyer that he really is. One irritating point: her (philosophic) idea that every raped woman should enjoy the rape just a bit: that wild notion probably was not derived from experiment! But that's the trouble with most of philosophy. It's just that: mere philosophy.
__label__2 bally blast: I bought this product because I was drinking a lot of coffee during the day, and that was starting to give me head aches... plus I hate yellow teeth and after a while dark drinks (such as coffee) tend to discolor my pearly whites, so I wanted something that would help me not want to go to sleep in the middle of the day... Before I tried caffeine pills... i cant remember which ones exactly it was about a year ago, but I do remember the coating was sweet and I did not like that at all, but anyways... those made me really jittery and after they wore off I would crash again and be soooo tired, but after taking Blast for a few days I have noticed a pleasant energy boost that doesnt make me feel all "hyped up" and jittery... I'm just not tired, and that is very nice.
__label__2 Sevendust- Sevendust: I have all the books -- they're all the same as any other guitar book. Except these guys rock. See if you can get the intro to Black down, it's sooooo cool when you do; people are so amazed when you pull that out of the bag of tricks.Best song...Speak!!!
__label__1 I thought high tech at first.: The only thing this is good for is to use as a shimmy. Can I get my money back please?
__label__2 Beautiful music to be savored: I am too far over the hill to use this for seduction as another reviewer suggests, but I can appreciate every track in this wonderful compilation for what they are: music played from and for the soul and heart.Everyone is going to have a favorite track or tracks - tastes vary. For me it's "I Can't Get Started" performed by Lester Young with the Nat King Cole Trio (in fact, my search for that song led me here). How High the Moon is another track that grabs me, but honestly, every track on this album is a winner.If you love great music, and especially if you love listening to sensual music that is greatly enhanced during the wee hours (with or without a companion) this album will bring a lot of pleasure. Listen to the track samples, then buy it!
__label__1 not good: not what is looked like...and not what i wanted. I was expecing something different and now i cant return it cuz it will cost more to return it then i actually spent on it
__label__1 Healer or Dennis Miller ?: As a medical practitioner who uses alternative healing methods I am an advocate of Caroline's approach, however this work is not very helpful. Despite the title, it is oriented ONLY toward psychic healers, and she rants excessively and it seems illogically at various sacred cows.
__label__1 Myss should be in films...: Myss should be in films...because all she ever does is project her own insecurities on to her audience. I get the feeling that if something happened to her that she didn't like she'll talk about it in her lecture, make the other person wrong to make her feel better about herself. She could really use a little vegetarianism or meditation, two practices seh seems to think that she is above.
__label__1 This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center: This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center. It has some good basic info, but all that info could have been summed up in about 10 pages. I went to the IBS treatment center web site. It is listed on every page of the book The web site sells probiotics that are much more expensive than anything else I have seen. They also offer medical services if you go to their center.I don't know anything about the IBS treatment center. Maybe it is a good place. If you want to buy a long advertisement in book form, you might like this book.
__label__1 Cheap and wrong size!: The description said 6 x 8 frame, which to me means it holds a 6 x 8 picture!!! No, these nimrods meant the measurement of the whole frame end to end on the outside. WTF? It is crappy cheap plastic too. Totally not happy. Booooooo!!!!
__label__1 Doesn't have feel of a good soccer ball: This ball's shell is altogether too hard for a quality soccer ball, and it feels too heavy. I'm returning mine.
__label__1 Not all natural: I thought about getting this product but then I found out that it contains mineral oil and white petrolatum - both are petroleum derived ingredients. Better, and safer, options would be Badger diaper cream or Burt's Bees Baby Bee diaper ointment which do not contain nasty synthetic chemicals.
__label__2 Beautiful harmony!: What a blessing to have this CD available. I bought several for gifts. The harmony and blending of voices is wonderful. It does my heart good. Thank you!
__label__1 Not a durable paddle: This paddle has a very limited durability. After purchasing two paddles, both ended up snapping off where the handle meets the rubber.
__label__1 Doesnt work as advertised: This is a cute toy, I will give them that. And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. It collapses on everything, it falls on her. We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. We could have done that with toys she already had. This was a waste of money.
__label__1 disappointed: I looked forward to the release of Ana and Ravi's new titles very much, but have to say I am disappointed.The workout is still a good one, but like what another reviewer had said, the background was very distracting and so was the inconsistent and roving camera. I also found the music too loud and the pace too fast.
__label__2 NEW ENGLAND ONLY is the focus: This is a compendium of New England horrors from past articles in 'Yankee' magazine....a little dry, but not a bad coffee table book if it is in good condition. Me, I got mine new some thirty plus years ago.It has good things on little known horrors such as the Worcester Tornado, lighthouse capsizings, gales, the Boston Molasses Flood, etc.
__label__1 don't buy for your kids...: Ham once again is teaching his extrabiblical teachings to our kids. Instead of teaching scripture, he is trying to profit from the new interest in dinosaurs for the benefit of his radical group. We need books that show real biblical teachings about science, not ones like this.
__label__1 Not sure about this: I find these cards very difficult to use. Shuffling is impossible and and the instructions vague. That said, I still like and am intriqed buy the idea of these cards. I believe that you can change your thoughts and change your life (Dr. Wayne Dyer). I am still wiling to give the cards a chance.
__label__2 So cute: My son loves it. My complaint is that it lasted about 8 months. I thought the battery died, but the whole engine did. Once dead, it's pretty useless because you can't push it on the tracks.Just bought a replacement.
__label__1 Blurry pictures: We bought this camera so we could take pictures while on land based excursions from a cruise ship. We had booked beach and kayak excursions and I didn't want to risk my camera to the water adventures. The price was right and I didn't really want to spend the amount needed to protect my Nikon from water as I figured only to take 20 or so pictures and probably never use the case again.The camera did and excellent job of taking pictures, but due to the protective case used to protect it from water, almost all my photos came out blurry. I'm sure that's due to the fact that the case is molded plastic. The camera outside of the case is fine for a simple 35MM.
__label__2 Herencia: I recommend this for persons interested in learning the culture and advancing their learning of Spanish; it proceeds at an easy to follow pace.
__label__2 Helpful guide but not for the beginner: I've read a number of books on FengShui, and found this book beautifully illustrated. It offered many details about the background and different types of feng shui methods, which while informative could be very confusing to a beginner. I agree with the other reviewers that although it was reader friendly, it offered few or too brief solutions and the possible need for another book. Perhaps her smaller books would be good companions to this one. Just-A-Note: At the same time I bought this, I also ordered CREATING SACRED SPACE with FENG SHUI, Learning the Art of Space Clearing by KAREN KINGSTON. After reading both books, I consider SACRED SPACE to be a must have, a book that should always be the first feng shui book anyone reads. It can change your life.
__label__2 Jolly, quirky historical fiction: Frances Trollope, famous in the 1800s for her book attacking the United States, ostensibly wrote this as a biography of her equally famous friend Fanny Wright, the radical and feminist. The story of her friend meanders through the pathways of Mrs Trollope's own life and adventures, which often take center stage in this jolly and edging-toward-doddering narrative. In this story of two now-forgotten women, we experience the struggles of living in the 1800s and the burgeoning nation of America, and it is all rather delightful, but Edmund White includes more. Through the veil of historical fiction, White contemplates gender inequality, American politics and culture, racial distinctions, and religion, and allows the readers to draw parallels to modern day. "Fanny: A Fiction" is a conversational, quirky novel that may surprise some readers.
__label__1 pulp: as bad ass as this sounds this is the biggest tease,....dont spend money on buying this item cause i dosent even work...or find out the hard way..............sincerly isaac coustemer since 2002pulp fan since 1998.............
__label__2 Wonderful meditation enhancement!: I've used many types of music over the years with my meditation. No matter how beautiful, the thing that has always bothered me is the fact that music creates a certain distraction factor. The melody, no matter how soft or subtle, makes me focus on it rather than my meditation (external focus vs. internal).This CD has changed that. It is wonderful and relaxing to listen to, but it has no true melody to create distraction. It is haunting, with a harmonic resonance that pulls me into a deep meditation unlike what I can typically achieve.
__label__2 A Great Book!!!!: With all the bad reviews,You might think this book is not good!!!But it don't!!! I LOVE FEAR STREET books and this is one of the best!!!It's way better then most of them!!!!read this book!!!I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Junk: Recieved this item in poor packaging (would you believe in a priority mail envelope?) I did not recieve the information I needed to make it work. My father worked 5 hours on this item, I chose Linksys because it sounded like adurable product.I tried to talk to the Amazon client but all he/she was concerned about was he/her rating and he/her would not answer any of my questions.It felt generic and then creepy and then it started to feel like harrassment. I reported them to Amazon and they stopped bothering me about the item.I ended up going to walmart and buying an expensive wireless modem at this point was through chasing cats. Works well.
__label__2 Great overview of various tarantulas!: I agree with the review of Tom Kavanaugh. I have uploaded some images of the cover and table of contents; which has a list of all the species covered. If you can't read the images go to my image gallery and you'll be able to see them there.
__label__1 Blech!: This is not a condemnation of the movie itself which is fantastic. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD is 16:9 and it is not, it's 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire screen or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player.
__label__2 80 years after...: 80 years after, we know a voyage thru the Tibet, Chine and Mongolia for the eyes and the pen of a young lady. A different land and people, a great aventure, great images, someones hand-coloured.
__label__1 4 Stars when it works - Mine only last 15 months: I had a Samsung LTM225W for 15 months and then it just went bad. (I replaced the power convertor to no avail). I'm now dealing with Samsung's extremely poor 12 month warranty offering. I've had TV last 20 years on me and now the most expensive TV I've ever bought didn't last 2 years! I'm very frustrated. If you buy Samsung products, consider getting an extended warranty plan since Samsung doesn't stand very firmly behind their products.
__label__2 One of his best, mix of sharp words on gentle music (german): He is like red wine, geting better and better over the years. No music for the background, you have to listen careful to the words.
__label__2 Helps with acne...: I normally use a 2% salicylic acid lotion for my acne. It doesn't completely solve my problem though so I've been looking for something stronger. This stuff is not exactly made for acne, but it is the same ingredient as my acne medicine except in a 3% concentration instead of 2%, so I thought I'd give it a try. One thing I like about it is that it has very few other ingredients (all of which are non-comedogenic), so I don't have to worry about the non-active ingredients causing me problems. It is slightly drying and has caused minor flaking, but nothing too major. I only use it at night though (and my regular 2% stuff during the day) because it doesn't work under make-up. It dries leaving an almost rubber-like coating on my skin, so when I try to apply make-up on top, the gel rubs off in a rubbery layer. It has made a minor improvement in my acne, but not as much as I'd hoped.
__label__2 It's a vacuum belt.: This is a good vacuum belt. It's also easy to replace. I only wish they lasted a bit longer, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. If you have tall carpet or simply happen to vacuum a lot, the belts can wear down fairly fast (after about 6 months, which is faster than I'd like). The down side is that they are expensive, but other than that, they're great.
__label__1 Too much Humanities: It focus too much in Humanities and its skills. It basically translates academia skills into teaching, and talk too much how useful teaching can be in other jobs. In science there is research without teaching, and there are probably (I hope) other skills that can be useful in non-academic jobs. I was looking for this kind of information or hints. It is true it gives some "tools" how to break your own research activities into more detailed "actions" (not really into skills), but still does not tell me which ones are interesting in non-academic jobs.
__label__1 Questionable and Off-Target: I read this as a middle-school student as part of a faith-based curriculum, and I largely feel that it is off-target and questionable in terms of its historical accuracy. Considering that modern society has defined ``truth'' in terms of that which is attainable by the scientific method, the title of the book ``When Science Fails'' is largely a contradiction: The questionable historical accounts given in the book could better be considered examples of ``When Humans Fail'' rather than profound criticisms of the scientific method itself.Read this book if: You do not understand the scientific method; you do not want to understand the scientific method; and you want to read historical allegories of why it is wrong.Do not read this book if: You value your time or money.
__label__1 Good Singing And Playing?: Here Grand Funk do neither, but one can only expect so much from a second string hard rock band of the seventies, Boston, they ain't. Needless to say, this is the most inaptly named album of all time. The band, which is neither Grand nor Funky, is likewise ineptly described.
__label__1 Poor Graphics: This is a 10 year throwback in graphics quality. Suitable for a 10 year old computer but not today's modern computers. Game is OK if you want to practice Blackjack but ancient in its graphic display.
__label__2 Shun Steel 8-inch Offset Bread: Good bread slicer. I like the way it slices softer bread and rolls with very little pressure that would squash the item with other knives I have on hand. Couple this with the Shun U2 sandwich knife.
__label__2 Far Side is incredible: I hardly think I need to explain why this book deserves 5 stars. Gary Larson is a genius and his one frame comics will have you laughing out loud again and again. If you're a fan of the Far Side, you will love this. If you're new to the Far Side, BUY THIS BOOK. It is incredible
__label__1 misleading: The add shows a kit but when they send it to you all you get is the book. The book is great but when I bought it I expected to get the whole kit.
__label__2 Catchy tunes!: As usual, once you hear the YGG music, you will be singing along and trying to learn all of the dance moves.
__label__1 No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside!: No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside! Very disappointed 3 year old.
__label__1 A one-joke concept that grows thin quickly: It's just not funny. Musically, there's nothing interesting going on. The sly wink of doing the punk cover of a mainstream pop song has rarely been used to good effect, and an entire album of them from a band that does nothing but is pandering to the sniggering punk kids of the worst kind.
__label__2 love it: Great educational video for preschool - first grade students. My son is currently in kindergarten and he just love these videos, which as helped him in his spelling words for school
__label__1 Not As Many as it seems: I was a bit disappointed with this volume. Probably should have paid more attention to the description. I assumed that there would be an exploded view of each gun I own-and wanted to buy. This would then serve as "do all" reference for componentry. Not quite--lot's of drawings but not some of the more common Taurus revolvers among others. Some of the drawings are also a bit difficult to see/read numbers part shapes etc..Not a bad investment-just not a great investment. Excellent paperweight!!
__label__1 Simplistic Waste of Time: This book was preachy, simplistic, boring and not helpful. It was neither motivational nor informative but it was a waste of money and my time.
__label__1 Don't waste your time or money: First this is not the original line up,far from it.Second it has WAY more pressing's than 200 or 300 and it's not a offical release from the band.I'm huge fan and I have one word for this.....CRAP!
__label__2 Pretty good; bottom more difficult than top: I've used them for the full 5 days, and they really do whiten your teeth. They are much thicker than the other brand that are a little slimy around your teeth. The strips are more of a wax like substance that takes a little while to mold to your teeth, so some firm pressing and holding / molding works. I find the upper strips get easier to work in than the bottom strips, and I even broke one of the bottom strips taking it out of the package! Otherwise, they work well for the short period they are in your mouth.
__label__2 Best product in its category.: Out of all of the whitening products I have tried, this product is the most user friendly. Nearly all of the "strips" on the market have the same levels of peroxide for whitening; the true product differentiatior is the usability of the product. This product conforms to teeth very securely, covers all areas, and does not loose its adhesiveness after 1.5 hours (as long as I have tested).
__label__2 1st Person Narrative Really Gets You In Evan's Head: I really enjoyed the 1st person narrative that the author uses to tell his story. A "coming of age" novel in which gay men can relate. Evan longs for love while finding only sex. The sex satisfies his hormones, yet he wants more... he wants normalcy. There's a clear under current hear that his orientation has developed from his enstranged relationship with his father. The characters are well drawn. Some of Evan's fantasies are hard to grasp and relate with in context to the story line. All in all, beautifully written.
__label__1 Not a true solution: I didn't find this method any different than the cry it out method. After all, you are just leaving your baby to cry in his crib...though the authors suggest only allowing so for an hour at naptime. Well, after an hour of sobbing uncontrollably, my baby could NOT get to sleep, and I was heartbroken that I even attempted this. There are gentler ways to help your baby sleep.
__label__2 Be an un-rude (not necessarily polite) Gaijin: If you are Japanese, this book will show you (1) how Americans who seem rude to you might actually be trying to be polite; and (2) how you can tailor your politeness to American ears.If you are American (or Western, in general), this book will teach you how to interpret as acts of politeness some seemingly quirky Japanese customs. However, if you want to learn how to be polite in Japan (rather than just un-rude), this book might well come up short.A rather short read, this book's coverage of Japanese-American misunderstandings is mostly anecdotal. Also, because the book is over 20 years old, it does not peer into the rather different minds of Japan's younger generations.
__label__2 Stylish and practical nursing top: love the front flap design of the Japanese Weekend D&A tops. Easy access and offers a lot of coverage. I own several of these styles. I do not need to use additional coverups when nursing in public, in fact. This particular top is a favorite as it is quite versatile. I wear it to work with black pants, add a jacket for meetings and pair it with jeans or yoga pants on the weekends. Plus, it is machine washable and does not need ironing. What else can a new mother ask for?
__label__2 Excellent: My daughter loves this series then got me hooked, too. Shocking, Funny, Intriguing, and romantic. Great music, too, which is always a plus. If you like One Tree Hill, I think you'll like this, too.
__label__2 Vampire Diairies: I like this series very much. It's very entertaining! I do believe that it is for the younger generation of today but I still enjoyed it immensely
__label__2 TVD S1: My only nitpick with the dvd is that there are no commentaries from the cast. I hope they remedy that with S2. I LOVE the show so there's nothing much else to say.
__label__2 great: I recieved this within 3 business days. The price was great. It is in great condition. I could not wait for them to come any faster.
__label__2 Vampire Diaries: season 1:: I like the show but again like the twilight saga why do they have to change the books when they take it to tv or make a movie out of it. I mean Elena has a little sister in the books not a teenage brother on drugs and where is her bestfriend Meredith? I like the show but it would be better if made more like the books
__label__1 Eye-candy for the simple minded: If you are a white teen female, love romances, and never want to emerge from your cutesy world....This is for you!
__label__1 Wasn't Impressed: I was not impressed with the pilot and probably will not watch again. It just wasn't entertaining as True Blood or Twilight. I think maybe we have enough different vampire shows to keep us entertained that we do not need another.
__label__2 What I've Read: I have read that the Season 1 DVD will be released on 8/31/10 & the 2nd season will start early September. No exact date. And I've also read that they are considering making a soundtrack of the show. I'm so hooked on this show.
__label__1 Vampires 90210: I tried. I really did try to like this show. But after a certain amount of stereotypical vamp-angst, teen drama, and bad acting, I finally quit. I gave it a fair chance--I think I quit 4 or 5 episodes in--but I just couldn't stand the level of the actors and even the script. The plot is okay, I suppose. If you're really into high school (or IN high school) and really into vampires... go ahead.
__label__2 great collection!: If you're a huge Vampire Diaries fan like me, you'll appreciate this collection and the series in HD. I only gave it one less star from perfect though because my Disc 2 skips during the Caroline/Damon bedroom fight. Other than that, I'm pleased with the content and love how well-written the series is when you put all episodes sequentially!Mind you, I'm also someone who thinks True Blood's storyline is lame and the Twilight saga is definitely too 'teen-ish'. This series falls just in between of both and it helps that Kevin Williamson is one of the involved writers/producers!
__label__2 good case: This is a good case for my new Sony camera, though the value for money aspect kept me from giving it a perfect score of five stars.The fit for the camera is snug, and it manages to provide the camera's body with adequate protection without being bulky. It also resists scratches -- I've used mine for several weeks and have already traveled with it a great deal, and it still looks new (and thanks to the case, so does the camera). It even comes with a variety of carrying straps, assuring that at least one will suit your needs. It is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the case, just as it did the camera.
__label__2 Great table: This table is easy to put together and just what we were looking for. Comes with all hardware -- just add the wood of your choosing. Note that the instructions are printed on the box (no paper instructions inside), so don't rip up or throw away the box before you read the instructions. Good product.Update (6/6/2012: It's been a little over 5 years since I bought this and posted this review in May of 2007, and this table and benches are still working beautifully, with only some sanding and painting of the wood. Definitely a good value.
__label__1 Incorrect Item: I orderd one item and received something else. This item was needed for an on-line class and due to the error I am behind schedule on my class work.
__label__1 defective--only two front wheels are turning: Our battery operated James is defective. At first we thought that this train is different built than our other battery operated train Salty and therefore weaker. Salty operates almost perfectly, chugs up the hills and takes the turns, whereas James could not go up hills and could not pull wagons, and overall seemed much slower than Salty. Upon closer inspection and comparison with Salty (after return period was already over), we discovered that for Salty 4 wheels are powering the movement (eg., battery makes two front wheels and two back wheels turn), whereas for our James only two front wheels are turning. Of course, it makes sense that this way James cannot move as fast and as well as Salty. So our James is defective...hoping that we can exchange it.
__label__1 Derails: We have Battery Operated Thomas and Battery Operated James. Other than the color they look very similar, and, I suspect, use the same mechanics. Unfortunately, James derails very often on the same tracks that Thomas has no problem navigating. I have two tracks: a coal sifter figure 8 and the oval starter kit from Target. James derailes on each one of the tracks separately as well as on the layout I created by combining the two sets. Sometimes it'd go around fine one time and then derail on the second run - very strange. Battery Operated Thomas almost never derails.On the positive side, my two-year old son loves these trains.
__label__1 If it worked consistently it would be amazing: As soon as the batteries were in my son was not interested in opening or looking at any other Christmas gifts. Sadly, it stopped working within the first hour of playing. My dad was able to jostle it back to life a few times and we changed the battery once and it worked again for about 10 minutes. Now it is completely dead. And its wheels don't work like the regular trains so my son can't use it manually either. We absolutely have to return it. I have read that the battery powered Thomas works better, so we will try to exchange it for that one. It had no problems staying on our imaginarium tracks, pulling cars or going up hills when it was working. If it worked consistently it would be the perfect toy. For $30 it should be more reliable. It is NOT a "very useful engine."
__label__1 Does not stay on curved track.: This engine is cute and seems to be well constructed. It does a good job of going up ramps, is easy to turn on and off, and takes a single battery. However, it kept running off any curves in the train track. We decided to return it and look for something that will stay on our son's track.
__label__2 This Gyro is an excellent classic toy: This Gyroscope is the high Quality Toy that used to be purchased at the local mall or the educational store. Now they have become hard to find. This Gyro is durable and comes with the string and the rip cord to start it with. It is an excellent tool for explaining motion and the physics behind the force that balances. I highly recommend this toy.
__label__1 extremely UNINFORMED!: In my opinion this book makes it look like SOMEONE didn't do very much research! Quite frankly, I hope that Ruth Brown Never writes another book that bashes any religion, like this book did! If you're buying this book to get a honest veiw of modern witch craft then you are going to be VERY disappointed. Like just about everyone on this page of reveiws has said, This book is just causing more ignorence and hate.
__label__2 If you are a Link Wray Fan!: I just bought this CD and it's really great! John is still as good as ever and plays his guitar as the hot artist he is. If you get into real rock stuff then dont miss this one! I saw John play with Mick Fleetwood and Anton Fig together on stage and it was really cool. Good luck John on this CD and we hope you will do another one soon!
__label__1 Disappointing: I thought that this would be gummy. I had some sticky putty like substance that was this size and came in a roll. I used it for flower arrangements and helping candles stand up in their holders. This was basically white paper. It held nothing and was useless. The postage to send it back was more than the cost. So it's just sitting in a drawer waiting to find a use for it.
__label__2 This is a great book for beginners!: I loved the recipes and nutritional information. There is even a list of manufacturers in the back of the book.
__label__2 The Nader Reader: Ralph Nader brought up many important issues in this year's presidential race. Many of these are seen throughout the writings in this book and it is apparent that the problems he talks about are not recent, nor are they going to go away without any massive efforts.Nader's style is a little dry and difficult to read at times, but the points he brings up (especially in the sections on the presidency, democracy, and grassroots organizing) are vital to the progressive movement. His sections on tort reform and law practice are a little more technical and are probably best understood by those in the field.Nader has stood by his convictions from the time he started fighting GM to today. This is an excellent book that traces his numerous crusades throughout the decades and gives a boost to the future.
__label__1 Written for the Intellectual Elite and Not the Average Reader: Ralph Nader has been around for some time and has had his day.He claims to be a populist, caliming to be for the people. However, when you read his books, you can see that he is really writing for the sake of the intellectual elite. He does not write to acoomodate average readers thus failing to get his point through to them. Well, so much for being a populist and a man of the people.Nader just does a lot of talking and writing and accomplishes nothing.In the presidential election, all he succeeded in doing was drawing votes away from Al Gore allowing George W. Bush to win the election giving us eight more years of Reagan-Bush policies which have ultimately led us to this financil disaster on Wall Street and all over the United States.
__label__1 Loquacious and another world: For a person living and working in the British Isles, 'Teach Yourself Copywriting' by J. Jonathan Gabay may be a fine read. But I don't live there. Residency aside, I found this book to be overly wordy to the point of feeling like I was slogging through swamps of verbiage to find a useful morsel. And there are useful bits there, it's just that it boarders on not being worth the time and effort to get to them. Someone interested in the topic of copywriting would do better to read similar books by Robert Bly or Peter Bowerman, both much more interesting and succinct; my apologies to Brits everywhere.
__label__2 Better than you realize: Like most, I was expecting(hoping) for something that hit me between the eyes as a classic(When doves Cry, Sign O' the times). And in that respect, I was disappointed. But being a fan, I forced myself to listen again without the expectations, as most non-fans will hear the song. And what I heard was a beautiful melody, a chorus that implants itself in your head, subtle guitar underscoring the singing, and harmonies that send chills. Yeah, it's commercial, but it's far, far better than most of the bland stuff I'm hearing on the radio. And nobody out there could sing a song like this the way he can.
__label__2 This is my first PDA/Organizer: I purchased this about 4 months ago and it really is easy to use especially if you are familiar with Microsoft Word and Excel. I use it to copy files from my PC that I want to have handy. The only thing I wish it had is a backlight. But that hasn't come into play too often. I usually have to charge it every 2 or 3 days. I recommend this product if you are not worried about having a lot accessories to go with it, because they are not that many available.
__label__1 Piece of Crap: I have ordered thousands of items in my lifetime, and bar none, this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever received. It is supposed to come completely put together, but when it arrived, there were no less than 10 little parts that had come off the screen assembly and one screen that was loose and all of its parts dangling. The first thing that happenned is that I cut myself on one of the screens because the protective side had come off. I was bleeding for quite some time. The second thing I noticed was the extremely poor quality of the material and assembly. I am very handy by nature, but even I had to give up trying to put this piece of junk back together again. Plus it was not worth it, even if I had put it together again, all I would have then had was a piece of crap fireplace screen.
__label__1 Okay at first, but died pretty quickly...: My parents ordered me these new speakers when they got me a new monitor. For awhile, they did work fine, and the sound quality was great. However, the other day, they randomly died on me after about 3 months' use. I'm stuck trying to find another relatively inexpensive set of speakers (while still giving the audio quality I'm looking for).
__label__2 Great Little Speakers for Music: I like to listen to internet radio and CDs while I work. Not listening too loudly, though I have been known to turn it up for the occasional song now and then. For my use and for the price, these are great speakers: not tinny, decent bass.
__label__2 Great Bench Kit!: I made a small (24" long) warming bench for sitting next to our new Tilikivi fireplace using cherry 2 x 4's finished with rubbing lacquer. The 2 x 4 Basic bench ends are very sturdy and attractive. The green color is nice, but I sprayed them flat black with all purpose paint to match our other fireplace accessories. High quality product.
__label__1 Neil Armstrong, A Good Man: Neil, A Good Man. Too bad he didn't land or walk on the moon.He was presented with a Deal he couldn't refuse. He didn't wantto end up like Grissom, White and Chaffee. So, he went along withthe program.Too bad this book is a book of fiction. No way there was a moon landingwhere men walked on the moon. Too bad James R. Hansen can't stand someonesaying something negative about his book.
__label__2 Works great!!: I purchased the item hoping that it would fit my Ridgid planner, which I purchased used and was about 8 years old.First I put through a piece of 2 X 6 without the collector on, what a giant mess! I put on the collector andI was stunned! 97% of all he wood shavings were sucked up. You can use the 4" port or 2 1/2" port.Buy this item, it will save you tons of time cleaning up
__label__1 Huh? The CD's over? Best nap I ever took.: Ferry, Ferry, Ferry. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? I can't believe that you mixed half of this crap. Frist off besides being boring, this complation is the same trance cd with the same songs that everyone else is putting out. With the likes of a genious such as Ferry Corsten, I expected something more. There are only a handful of songs that redeemed this cd. I'm not saying that the songs on it are bad, but rather old and played out. If I have to hear Bt's Dreaming on one more CD this year, I'm gonna shoot myself! If you truly like your trance to make you get up and dance, check Ferry's earlier work on the MOS series or check out any of the Euphoria cd's or Dj Tiesto. If you have a hard time going to sleep, this is the cd for you.
__label__2 The Celtic Knotwork Handbook, a perfect book for beginers: If you are just getting started, or have been interested in knotwork for a while, this is a great book! It provides historical information, diagrams, how to make circular knots, anamorphics, and more than 100 original knots, which include corners, borders, and motifs. This is the best keltic knot book I've seen.
__label__2 We love Mr. Putter and Tabby!: My children, ages three and five, adore Mr. Puuter and Tabby, and I believe this is Ms. Rylant's funniest rendition of their adventures so far. When the box arrived, I read the book alone because I couldn't stand to wait. Ms. Rylant uses a nice collection of short and medium-length words for beginning readers, and the story rollicks along. Mr. Howard's illustrations capture the subjects' expressions beautifully. We checked these books out of the library so often that we finally ordered some to keep.
__label__1 Not unless you're a time traveler: ... This book is OLD and nigh unto useless unless you frequently travel in time to the first month after MacOS X Server was released. There's a reason why brick-and-mortar stores remove books from shelves and place them on the [bargain] rack. ...
__label__1 not useful anymore: While this book seemed very appealing for someone who is new to Mac OS X server and its Linux underpinnings, it is almost worthless at this point in time since it has not been updated to include the major changes that have been made in the past couple years. Save your money and visit online resources; they are much more valuable.
__label__1 MAC OS X SERVER Administrator's Guide: I was looking for a book that would be a guide to OSX Server since the information included with the software was thin at best. What I found was a text that took the little information that I found in the documentation and puffed it up to over 300 pages with not much more to offer. In all fairness I did pick up some information but it was not worth the price. I'll keep the book on the shelf but it will not be looked at often.
__label__1 Bulb: 10,000 hours; transformer: 250 hours: The bulb is rated for up to 10,000 hours, but the transformer only lasted about 250 hours. The transformer is part of the cord and is not replaceable. Ott-Lite won't respond to my e-mail inquiries and doesn't list transformers as a replacement part. I tried a variety of sources for an 18w. transformer that could be modified to accommodate the lamp, but the cheapest I could find was about $30.00. I bought a brand new Hampton Bay table lamp (similar to the Ott-Lite lamp) at Home Depot for $20.00. If your Ott-Lite ceases to work you'll probably assume that the bulb must be replaced and spend $15.00 or so for a new bulb, only to discover that it's not a bulb problem. So you end up with a lamp that won't work and two bulbs you can't use on any other fixture. Don't buy Ott-Lite products...and exchange any Ott-Lite gifts you might receive.
__label__1 Don't Buy Ott: Buyers, be warned! I bought an Ott Lite a year ago, and was using it for needlework. Then one day, it did not work. I bought a new bulb for it, and it still didn't work. Then I learned about the ballast problems, and join the long line of people that bought from Ott and have expensive lights that no longer work. A beautiful lamp is now done for. I'll never buy another Ott product again. Steer clear!
__label__2 Super.: This item is all I expected and more wooooow no more back ache...Buy if u have a chance and get rid of back ache
__label__2 Extremely Useful for Me and Others: As a teacher and collegiate athletic coach I found "Taming Your Gremlin" and "A Master Class in Gremlin Taming" to be extremely beneficial. Carson's Gremlin Taming method helps me be aware of the barriers I create that limit my potential. By being aware of my own blocks, I am able to help my students and athletes notice theirs as well. We can both then move toward unleashing our fullest potential.While mastering Gremlin Taming is a life-long pursuit, I notice that the Method is easily applicable. It is for this reason I have given "A Master Class" and "Taming Your Gremlin" to All American athletes and Honor students. Often the difference between being good and being great is in their mentality.I strongly suggest "Taming Your Gremlin" and "A Master Class" to any teacher or coach who wishes to help their students or athletes excel.
__label__2 I like this keyboard a lot!: My keyboard at work is so easy to use that I had to find something better for home. This one is actually really good for the price. It's not as flat as the one I have at work (sony vaio) but it is still really easy to use compared to most and it doesn't take up much room on my desk which is nice. I type extremely fast so I was looking for something that would keep up. This one does. The keys are fairly flat and light. I'm glad I bought it.
__label__1 Not for beginners!: There is way too much talking and detailed explanations. If you're looking for a quick yoga exercise, this DVD is not for you.
__label__1 Cheap plasticy looking and can't see the light 3 feet away: Buy this if u have money to spend on junk stuff that you are no going to use. I never knew halogen light was so dull. I dont believe personally that this has a halogen bulb.
__label__2 I really love Puff Daddy and R. Kelly's songs.: I'm so happy they made this song together because having them together makes the song sound tight.It also reminds me of one of my best homegirls, Sheila.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: I expected more about how to create luck, maybe why people feel lucky and how they obtain it, not read pages and pages about luck in the casinos. Nothing really helped me in this book. Explaining others' Gambling and lucky streaks did nothing to help me and in fact bored me. Absolutely no meat to this book. Since I don't gamble, I thought I would scream when more and more pages about gambling began. This book was not what I expected at all. Very disappointed.
__label__1 Strange but, listenable: This is not what I expected. I thought this was an all out rock band and to my dismay I found noise. I can actually sit down and listen to this though. Another review mentioned Merzbow...I think they hit the nail on the head. It has a hint of Meat Beat Manifesto also. I think some of Mike Pattons work also is along this same route.
__label__1 CRAP: this is not music, no matter what anyone says. Its crap! anyone can make these tracks. to write an album like this you need the following: 1. no talent, what so ever. 2. loop a bunch of randomized drum beats, then put distortion on em. 3. have some idiot screaming with heavy distortion and a vocoder in the backround about death. 4. have some low end wet synth bass playing somthing that makes no sence 5. every 20 seconds have some annoying ass distorted ear bleeding noise come in and then cut off real short. 6. dont forget to tie yourslef in to the industrial scene. if you want real talent!? and still want that industrial noise? look up a band called "the lack" they kill!
__label__2 Obey the warning: This is a fun toy and my 2 and 6 year olds love it. However, there is a very hard to read warning on the underside of the train that says that hair may become tangled in wheels. They are not kidding! I had to cut that train out of my two year olds hair when he picked it up off the track and lifted it too close to his head. It happened in an instant! It was a bit traumatic for both of us. Fun toy, but can be dangerous.
__label__1 Unbelievable- In a Bad Way: We bought this Thomas for our son who is a huge Thomas fan, and has a huge set up in his room. He has both the Thomas(this product, bought somewhere else) and the Percy model. The Thomas we had stopped working, and was a older model, so we bought this one to replace it. Our son was very upset when we had to retire his older Thomas, but we promised him a new one.We bought this product, and waited patiently to add it to our son's Thomas collection. When it came, we opened it right away, and were shocked when we were looking at the Percy instead of Thomas.We coulda/woulda/shoulda contacted the seller, but this "Thomas" product is already in our Tildsmen shed, since we opened the package with our son.With so many places to buy genuine Thomas gear, if you are paying the premium Thomas price, we expected a better product experience.
__label__1 Almost Great, Until it Broke...: My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago. He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on our Mellissa and Doug train track. He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue. It did, however, break after one fall from counter height. My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken. It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train. Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it.
__label__1 Disappointed !!!: I bought this toy for my son who loves the "Thomas" toys. You need one battery to operate the train and it seems to work well - it can pull other cars quite weel and climb up and down the tracks. However, what I was not happy with was the advertizing on the box - which clearly stated that the toy can be also be pushed manually by the child. THIS IS NOT TRUE (unless I had two faulty trains)!! My son likes to watch the train pull the cars on its own, but he also like to the the pushing himself. You are not able to do that with this train. It is just meant for watching.
__label__2 Classic Jessica Mitford: This is a compilation of a wide range of Mitford's articles, the best of which, such as her skewering of the "Famous Writers' School", are timeless classics. This is a superb collection, and a complete delight to read.
__label__1 Comedy Scene, and Not Heard: This DVD will be a disappointment if you get it hoping to see some substantial portion of the acts of the various comics listed on the cover. All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out together and getting their start.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere.
